# Notes_Obsidian

## About
These are my notes on (almost) every book/blog/white paper I read and podcast/interview I listen to. You can use this folder to read my notes on GitHub itself since all the files are in .md format but since there are a lot of notes that refer to each other, and a lot of notes that have links that might only work in *Obsidian* I highly recommend you **use *Obsidian*** to view/edit the notes.
A lot of the notes in the folder will be empty, because either:
  1. I have not *yet* read that book/paper but I intend to come to it in the future; or
  2. I have read it but I haven't updated it in Obsidian yet. I had been using Microsift OneNote for the past more couple of years and I'm still in the process of shifting all my notes to Obsidian.


## Steps to use:
1. Make sure you have Obsidian installed. [Click here](https://obsidian.md/download)
2. Click the green-coloured "Code", and then "Download ZIP".
3. Unzip the file into a folder. This folder is going to be your **Obsidian Vault**.
4. Start the Obsidian desktop application.
5. Select "Open folder as vault" and browse to the folder where you unzipped the downloaded folder.
