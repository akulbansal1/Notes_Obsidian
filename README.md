# Notes_Obsidian

## About

These are my notes on (almost) every book/blog/white paper I read and podcast/interview I listen to. You can use this folder to read my notes on GitHub itself since all the files are in *.md* format but since there are a lot of notes that refer to each other, and a lot of notes that have links that might only work in *Obsidian* I highly recommend you **use *Obsidian*** to view/edit the notes.
A lot of the notes in the folder will be empty, because either:
  1. I have not *yet* read that book/paper but I intend to come to it in the future; or
  2. I have read it but I haven't updated it in Obsidian yet. I had been using Microsoft OneNote for the past more couple of years and I'm still in the process of shifting all my notes to Obsidian.


## How to use:

1. Make sure you have Obsidian installed. [Click here](https://obsidian.md/download)
2. Click the green-coloured "Code", and then "Download ZIP".
3. Unzip the file into a folder. This folder is going to be your **Obsidian Vault**.
4. Start the Obsidian desktop application.
5. Select "Open folder as vault" and browse to the folder where you unzipped the downloaded folder.


## FAQs

1. Why create/maintain your personal notes/research resources and share them publicly?
	- <u>Why take extensive notes</u>: I think there will be a ChatGPT-like software in the not so distant future that will take note-taking a searching through your personal notes to the next level. It's not so difficult to (and very exciting to) imagine an AI searching through your notes. It's as close to 'Building a Second Brain' as one can imagine. Keeping this in mind, I try to keep my notes 'programming-friendly'. As to <u>why share it publicly</u>: all the stuff that I read/listen usually come from some other researcher who is sharing the research resources, which I find VERY helpful. This repository came into existence because I want to be able to help others the same way I have been helped by others.

2. Some texts are highlighted `like this. Are these typos?`
	- No, they are not. Although backticks are used to denote `code` in Markdown, I use them to denote my thoughts. I have tried to keep the notes as unbiased as possible and so `texts that look like this` denote my annotations.
	- Sometimes, though, they denote the a code block. It's quite clear by the context of the notes, I promise.

3. There are a lot of links that I am unable to open. How do I open those?
	- I save PDFs of most papers/books I read and insert a link to them in the notes file. Unfortunately, my "Library" is 5 Gigabytes therefore, difficult to upload on GitHub since GitHub doesn't allow single push of >2 Gb. Also, I don't want to get sued by Wiley!

4. Why are the dates in a weird 8-digit number?
	- The 8-digit number is YYYYMMDD, the reason being it is easier to sort the dates when it is in this format.

5. How do I get in touch with you, if I need any help or just to chat?
