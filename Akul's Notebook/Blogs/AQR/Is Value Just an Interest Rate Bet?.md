- "Growth (or often just 'tech') stocks soar on plunging interest rates (or vice versa) has become a common wise-sounding observation in the last few year. […] However it's not nearly that simple, and mostly it's just not true".
- "the rolling five-year monthly correlation of the Fama-French value factor (HML) returns for the U.S. with the contemporaneous change in the U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield".![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 7.19.45 PM.png]]

- "the most recent five years has seen quite high correlations between the value factor and interest rates, bouncing around the highest ever observed and economically significant".

- "On average, using our very diversified global value factor to sort stocks, the expensive one outgrow cheap ones by about 4% a year over the next five years".
- "It seems, particularly if you, like me, think we're in a bubble, that growth investors are all trying for unicorns [the grey line growing at 10% for 50 years on the left sub-graph of the figure on the right] […]. What growth investors […] actually historically get is excess growth (4% a year faster for growth than value for the next five years, then equal thereafter)".![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 7.21.07 PM.png]]
- "If all three investments [value, growth, and unicorn] are assumed to have equal long-term expected returns (IRRs here as we're doing bond math) the 'duration' of the growth portfolio (blue line) is 0.4 years longer than the duration of the value portfolio. If you think that's trivial, you are correct. Now, under these assumption, the duration of our unicorn portfolio is about 10 years longer than either value or growth".
- "It is not the level of earnings that affects duration, it is the time shape, and the only way to really affect the time shape enough to seriously move duration is to make assumptions of large and extremely long-lasting (way more than 5+ years out) growth differentials that historically do not exist".

- "So why has value versus growth been trading the way it has in recent times? […] If we're in a bubble, then many must be assuming their growth portfolio is more like the unicorn example above than what real life has ever delivered. If they believe that, it then follows they also believe growth stocks are considerably longer duration than normal relative to value stocks".

- "the very high (tech bubble level) prices being awarded to growth versus value stocks, and the realized correlation of value versus growth and interest rates, could easily be the same bubble showing up in different ways".

- "I do not find that low interest rates justify super cheap value versus growth prices".

- "a forty-year bond rally (particularly in real rates) has raised equity price. It just shouldn't change relative equity prices (diversified value versus diversified growth) more than a tiny bit, if at all".
