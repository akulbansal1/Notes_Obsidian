- Some basic things:
	- "We like things that look cheap versus things we think are comparable to them".
	- "We like things that are getting better in terms of price and fundamentals".
	- "We like more profitable things".
	- "We like lower beta things".
	- "We like higher carry things".
- "You can explain a lot of his [Warren Buffet's] returns by the fact that he looks for cheap, profitable, low beta stocks"
	- **"the other thing he did was when they go down 70%, he never ever ever backed of"**
- "In the long-only world, I think, they [clients] take a longer term aspect. Once you call something 'absolute return fund' or 'hedge fund' or 'market neutral fund', for some reason that does not jibe with any of the data, not just AQR, people think it just always goes up and that clientele tends to be a little more short term".
- "If you think you have something real, you want to get to do it for 30 years. If you don't think you have something real, charge as much as you can and go when the getting's good. It's not my plan, I'm not advocating it"
- This year, there are two main drivers [in the massive outperformance of AQR funds]:
	- **Value**:
		- "I just wrote a [[We Are Not Just Value Except You Know When We Are.pdf|blog piece]] on this. We go through 10-15 year periods when we hardly talk about the value factor. It's one of many factors we trade. […] Then once every 20 years, so far it's the tech bubble and then from 2018 through now […] value goes totally mad. We suddenly are value managers".
		- "Everyone thinks it's interest rates [for the reason why Value is coming back] some of it is. […] If you look over 50 years of data, they are [value factor and interest rates] virtually uncorrelated. Over the last 5-7 years, the value trade has been very correlated to interest rates and I actually think it's probably a mistake".
	- **Trend-following**:
		- "Trend-following strategies are trying to create something that, on average, does well in really bad times and doesn't cost you a ton".
		- "It's imperfect protection with negative cost [positive expected returns over the long run]".
		- "That's been going like gang-busters too".
- "How I get through a tough evening: If this wasn't so hard to stick with, it would, in fact, get arbitraged away" #quote_general_gyaan 
- "Expensive can mean it just makes less than normal for a long period, it doesn't have to crash".
