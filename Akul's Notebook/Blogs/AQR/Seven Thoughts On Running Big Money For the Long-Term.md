## <u>Introduction</u>
- "be skeptical of anyone offering a silver bullet"

## <u>1. Embrace Risk – In the Long Term, You'll Need It</u>
- "in general, you do not get compensated for any extra risk you take on that nobody must bear (e.g., under diversifying is a risk you don't get paid for)"
- "Expected returns are low versus history, but still decently positive".![[Screenshot 2023-07-24 at 4.34.04 PM.png]]"It is possible instead that past returns may have been too high for many reasons (excessive risk aversion after the Great Depression, inability of investors to actually achieve these returns due to transaction costs, taxes, absence of low cost index funds and other barriers to diversifying.)"
- "Long-term institutions make most of their money by taking risk. Most of that risk will come from beta."

## <u>2. To Survive in the Long-Term, Brace Yourself for the Short-Term</u>
- "you have to protect yourself form disaster. The way to do this is *not* by buying insurance, as that is almost always a sucker's game long-term"
- "At the individual manager/portfolio level I'm again nihilistic you can avoid them [shocking events] entirely, but what you can make sure is that if it happens somewhere it does not kill you"
- "long-term perspective can also be more directly monetised by trading liquidity needs for return"

## <u>3. Diversify Your Market Risk as Much as Possible</u>
- "Shifting to a risk budgeting framework can improve results by more clearly highlighting the true degree of concentration in certain types of risk"
- "The general principle of combining a highly diversified portfolio with enough leverage (or cash) to attain your risk goals is likely the best way to structure your beta portfolio, and this is where you'll get most of your return. If this is too radical, you can still move as much in this direction as possible"
