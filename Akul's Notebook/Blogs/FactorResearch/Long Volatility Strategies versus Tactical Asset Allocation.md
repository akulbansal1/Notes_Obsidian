- "many uncorrelated strategies like hedge funds or private equity have been found to provide nothing more than hidden equity exposure"
- "Long volatility strategies are more suitable [than tail-risk hedge funds] as they feature only moderately negative correlations, but there are only a few asset managers offering this strategy"

- "Long volatility strategies aim to benefit from rising or high stock market volatility, and use options as well as risk-off assets in portfolio construction"
	- Pay-off will be lower than perfect hedge but the 'cost' during good times will be lower too.
- Replicating CBOE Long Volatility Index, it "seems historically a simple equal-weighted combination of gold and JPY-AUD would have approximately replicated the performance of the long volatility index"
	- "However, although JPY-AUD represented risk-off asset historically, it is clear that this will not always work going forward"
	- "The JPY-AUD would likely change from a risk-off to risk-on asset"
- "TAA strategies aim at generating higher risk-adjusted and not necessarily higher absolute returns than the stock market"

- "The difference between long volatility and TAA strategies is that they provide different diversification benefits. TAA strategies are ideal for long and slow bear markets as they exit equities and preserve capital"
	- "long volatility strategies benefit from sharp increases in volatility. [â€¦] TAA strategies tend to have long lookback periods and do not exit quickly enough"![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 7.37.35 PM.png]]
