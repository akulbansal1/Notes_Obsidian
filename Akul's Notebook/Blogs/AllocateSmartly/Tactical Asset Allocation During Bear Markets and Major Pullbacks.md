- TAA manages losses during major market declines "by reducing allocation to risk asset classes like stocks and real estate, and increasing allocation to defensive assets like bonds and gold".![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 2.26.30 PM.png]]
- Key takeaway:
	- "During prolonged bear markets (like the 2007-09 GFC) TAA would have significantly outperformed the market as it sidestepped the worst of the decline and had time to being slowly ramping up risk again as the market recovered. This is the TAA's bread and butter".
	- "During short, sharp pullbacks (like 2018 and 2020) TAA also would have sidestepped the worst os the market loss, but then given back the outperformance, becuase it was positioned too defensively for the sharp recovery"
- "it takes about 3 months for TAA (on average) to de-risk during bear markets, so some loss during the initial market decline is expected"
