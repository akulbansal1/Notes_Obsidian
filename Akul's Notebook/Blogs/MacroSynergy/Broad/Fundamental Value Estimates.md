# The fundamental issues with fundamental value

## The grand theory
- Estimating value conscientiously "require three essential ingredients:"
	1. all relevant features of the security or contract.
	2. "an appropriate model of the uncertain environment ('stochastic parameters')".
	3. "an asset pricing model that discounts all cash flows or utility to a single present value".
- however, this is not practical. "In practice, few institutional investors have the budget, capacity, and know-how for such research, leave alone the patience".

## The humble reality: valuation ratios
- "simple price-based valuation ratios, such as trade-weighted real exchange rates for currencies, real interest rates for fixed income instruments, or earnings yields for equity".
- "simple valuation ratios are not valid approximations for fundamental value gaps"
- "judgement on whether valuation ratios are too high or too low depends completely on context"
- "without further analysis, valuation ratios cannot plausibly be a great source of investor value"

## Persistent mis-pricing and sudden re-pricing
- "price-value gaps can be wide and persistent [...] but can also offer huge profit opportunities when markets undergo [[Critical transitions in financial markets|critical transitions]]"
- value performs the best after momentum [[The relation between value and momentum]]
- "value factors are a complement to trend following or momentum strategies"

## Absolute versus relative value
- "usually easier to estimate relative fundamental value across similar contracts rather than absolute fundamental value"
- empirical analysis supports the intuition that is easier [[The predictability of relative asset returns]]


# Practical hints

## Fundamental value approaches in macro space #idea_value_investing
- Fixed Income
	- long-term yields can be decomposed. [[The four components of long-term bond yields]]. "Fundamental value gaps can arise from the mis-pricing of any of these components"
	- "the main challenge is to separate term premia from unbiased forward rate expectations" [[The term premium of interest rate swaps]].
	- Term premia can be estimated by using macroeconomic variables as inputs. [[Term premia and macro factors]].
	- Inflation risk premia "can be positive or negative, depending on whether the inflation is expected to be negatively or positively correlated with broad (equity) market returns and economic growth" [[Inflation risk without premium]] and [[Understanding negative inflation risk premia]]
	- "models should consider time-varying parameters, time-varying volatility, and even model uncertainty" [[Predicting bond returns]]
- Equities
	- [[Earnings yields, equity carry and risk premia]] "forward earnings yields are a common and valid basis for fundamental value estimates, particularly if they are adjusted for risk or volatility".
	- [[Predicting equity market corrections]] "earnings yields and differentials between equity dividend yields and bond yields".
	- [[Accounting data as investment factors]] "accounting values are as much driven by assessment of risk as it is by economic value".
	- [[The predictability of market-wide earnings revisions]] "market-wide forward earnings forecasts usually follow price adjustment with a lag, and this predictability can be used to increase the quality of real-time forward earnings yields".
	- [[Improving the information value of dividend yields]] "considering other forms of cash returns such as share buybacks and debt redemption to get a broader and more meaningful 'shareholder yield'".
	- [[A market-to-book formula for equity strategies]] "profitability and investment value-added explain most of the variations in the market-to-book ratio and must plausibly be taken into consideration for investment strategies that based on market-to-book ratios".
- Foreign Exchange
	- "look jointly at real effective exchange rate and economic performance data"
	- [[FX strategies based on real exchange rates]] "real exchange rates that are adjusted for relative productivity growth and product quality differences".
	- [[The concept of 'real financial exchange rate']] "a country's competitiveness plausibly have some predictive power".
	- [[Why and when central banks intervene in FX markets]] "apparent misalignment of effective exchange rates that go against the desired relative monetary policy stance is a key indicator of FX intervention risk".
	- [[Debt-weighted exchange rates]] "use weights based on foreign-currency-denominated debt and measure the effect of exchange rate changes on the cost of funding".
- Emerging Market
	- "external current account balances are the most popular indicator of valuation gaps for currencies and local-currency bonds".
	- "vulnerability to 'stops' in financial flows does not depend on trade and capital flows but only on the volume and origin of financing". [[How current accounts mislead FX markets]]
	- "one needs a broad set of competitiveness indicators and to diagnose vulnerability one needs the international investment position".

## Contract and market specifics
- "A necessary condition for estimating fundamental value is a full understanding of the contract and the underlying asset"
- example: "commodity futures in the base metal space, where at expiry holders looking for delivery would have had to accept long delays in the load-out from designated warehouses" [[Metals price distortions and the warehouse system]]
