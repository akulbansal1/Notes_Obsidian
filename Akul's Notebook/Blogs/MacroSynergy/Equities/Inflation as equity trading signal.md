- "A fresh analysis of 17 international markets since 2000 confirms an ongoing pervasive negative relation between published CPI dynamics and subsequent equity returns"
- "Downward shifts in expected inflation also seem to increase equity valuations"
	- "The nominal risk-free rate is more sensitive than the cash flows to changes in expected inflation"
	- "a decrease in expected inflation increases the value of levered equity"

- "To make the effects of inflation changes comparable across the range of 17 developed and emerging countries, they have been scaled based on the currency areas' effective inflation target"
- #idea_macro_trading "there has been a highly significant negative correlation between recorded inflation changes and subsequent returns on both a monthly and quarterly basis"![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.06.08 PM.png]]
- #idea_macro_trading "We define an inflation overlay simply as the subtraction of a winsorized z-score (inflation changes divided by their panel standard deviations and contained at a maximum value of 2) from a notional unit value. Positions are being rebalanced once per month at the beginning of the month"![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.07.49 PM.png]]
	- "if there has been no inflation change recorded in a country the position is equal to the long-only portfolio"
	- "if the inflation increase has been more than one standard deviation the portfolio even takes a short position"
	- "if inflation has decreased the long position is increased up to a maximum of 2 (i.e. double the long-only exposure)"

- "An alternative inflation-based signal is 'excess inflation', meaning the latest annual CPI inflation rate less the effective inflation rate"
