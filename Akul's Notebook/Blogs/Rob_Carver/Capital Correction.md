- Three methods of capital correction:
	1. Fixed Capital
	2. Full Compounding
	3. Half Compounding

- <u>Fixed Capital:</u>
	- capital doesn't change regardless of any losses or gains we make![[Pasted image 20230601180144.png]]
- <u>Full Compounding:</u>
	- increase the capital for losses, and reduce it for gains![[Pasted image 20230601180231.png]]
- <u>Half Compounding:</u>
	- Rob uses this method.
	- Any losses are used to reduce risk capital. Any gains that brings us up to the point where we recover those losses are used to increase capital. However, once we are the original capital level again, we don't increase risk if we go above this.![[Pasted image 20230601180352.png]]
	- "It's possible to use a partial compounding methods, between half and full compounding. 'Three quarter' compounding would mean taking half of any profits generated above the high water mark and adding these to risk capital; losses below the HWM would still impact on capital in their entirety"

- Conclusion
	- Compounding account curves "have little or no value for system evaluation and understanding"
	- "For actual trading though I recommend you use either the full compounding method or half compounding method; both of which you can backtest easily if you wish"
	- "Most traders might fall somewhere between these two stool; letting some of their returns compound but making withdrawals to cover taxes and augment other income"
		- "in live trading setting your risk capital equal to your account value will ensure you have your risk correct"
