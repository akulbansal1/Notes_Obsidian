This is part 1 in four part series
[[Forecasting linearity and forecasting mean reverting volatility|Part 2]]
[[Should I run my trading system at a fixed expected volatility target?|Part 3]]

- "A forecast is a calibrated expectation for future risk adjusted returns"
- Using non binary forecast, that scales positions according to conviction of forecasts "will improve your risk adjusted returns compared to using binary forecasts"
- "If forecasts work, then we can use capital more efficiently by only taking positions in instruments with large forecasts".

- Look at the figure.![[Screenshot 2023-06-01 at 6.14.47 PM.png]]
	- "there is indeed a roughly linear and fairly monotonic positive relationship between forecast and subsequent risk adjusted return, until the final bin (which represent forecast values of over 17)"
	- The forecast line reverts at extremes for two reasons:
		- Trends getting exhausted after a while
		- High forecasts are usually caused by very low volatility
- "non-binary is better: the stronger your forecast, the larger your position should be"
- "Along the way we've uncovered some curious behaviour particularly for slower momentum rules where it look like the forecast response is dampened or even reverts at more extreme levels"
