- "most alpha presented by managers can be attributed to model misspecification"
- *"The only source of (positive) returns is beta. And since ultimately risk premiums are the only sustainable source of investment returns, at the basis of every source of beta, there is one (or more) source of risk"*
	- *"If all source of beta are properly taken into account, the only alpha remaining will be a negative alpha, resulting from inefficiencies in capturing the beta aimed for"*
- "the harder-to-capture types of beta require more skill than easily-captured types of beta"
- Using simple linear regression, alpha is the intercept. They compared S&P 500 and NASDAQ with each other and found positive 'alpha' in both the cases.
	- But it's not alpha, the manager seems to be producing excess returns because "not all relevant beta-factors are included"
- There's nothing "when an investment managers taps returns from other, uncorrelated, sources". But the managers "should be transparent about this alternative source of returns rather than passing it off as skill"
- "For investment purposes, one should not seek doubtful skill [possibility of alpha generation], but fully responsible risk management [actively avoiding negative alpha], which is a skill as well. And a valuable one"
- "In our definition, alpha can be compared to health: both qualities are desirable to have, but they do not exist in and of themselves"
	- His is the absence of injury and diseases "but one cannot acquire health. The same holds for alpha in investing: one may strive to avoid negative alpha, but no pharmacy or investment strategy is able to deliver positive alpha"

- Negative alpha is higher in harder-to-capture type of beta.
- An example of an easy-to-capture beta: passive long-only index investment. More on this [here](https://www.transtrend.com/en/insights/impact-index-tracking/)
	- Graph 1 shows the negative alpha caused by the buying/selling of an index fund![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.38.29 PM.png]]
- An example of a harder-to-capture beta: index arbitrageur collecting risk premium (tracking error)
	- The blog shows how even this strategy generates negative alpha
- Truly passive strategy can be outperformed. "An investor who is rather indifferent about his allocation to A or B can decide to hold whichever position in both markets. In case of inflows he can buy the cheaper one, and in case of outflows he can sell the more expensive one"
	- "he can buy the cheaper one while selling the more expensive one whenever this will bring him closer to a predetermined soft target allocation"
	- "What we have just described is traditional active long-only investing. This used to be the dominant investment approach before the investment industry became gripped by an over-academicized fixation on rather abstract return drivers, **gradually losing touch with some of the fundamental role of investors such as offering liquidity**"

- Trend following performance during crises is not because of its ability to go short stocks.
- "A key element [of outsized returns during market stress] is that the program [trend following] does not only trade futures on stock markets, but also on currencies, interest rates and commodities, […] and it does so in a fully integrated way"
	- A crisis doesn't just come out of nowhere. "It normally starts with a local problem in some part of economy, which then escalates and affects global stock markets"
- The  scenario in which a diversified trend following strategy will not be able to profit from a crisis in equity markets: either
	1. "**when a crisis starts with a sharp market reaction within the center of the global stock markets**" or;
	2. "**when a crisis starts with an escalating development in a part of the economy in which the strategy is not sizably positioned**"
	- "little can be done to protect the strategy against the first scenario"
	- "including as many markets as possible in the trading universe" used to do the trick in protecting from the second scenario due to changes in the correlation structure"
		- "We've experienced that a more targeted approach is now required to get an stay sizably positioned in enough truly different trends"
		- **Your goal is to be "sizably invested in the trend that will escalate into the next crisis**"
- "Although some trading styles, by nature, are more sensitive to negative crisis alpha than others, most of this sensitivity is not style-specific. It is mostly the result of operational choices"
	- "**The number-one requirement for avoiding negative crisis alpha is therefore to be in complete operational control**"
- "An environment with more risk naturally offers more opportunities - more beta - for an investment strategy aimed at harvesting the associated risk premium"
	- "But that beta will only be fully capture by those managers that, when push comes to shove, don't shy away from this risk"
