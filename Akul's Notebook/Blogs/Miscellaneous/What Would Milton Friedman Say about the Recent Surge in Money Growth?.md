- "M2 money supply grew at annualized rates exceeding 20 percent throughout much of 2020".

- Milton, in his Monetary History of the United States, "uses a narrative approach to link fluctuations in the money supply to subsequent movements in output, employment, and inflation".
- "statistical links between measures of the money supply and other key macroeconomic variables weakened in the late 1980s and early 1990s".
	- "although the statistical relationships between money growth, real GDP growth, and inflation may have weakened somewhat in recent decades, they have in no way disappeared".

## Money, Business Cycles, and Inflation
- From 1867 to 1960, "money growth consistently peaks just before output and employment reach their own cyclical peaks, and money growth troughs just before output and employment hit their cyclical troughs".
- "According to Friedman and Schwartz, the initial economic downturn following the stock market crash of 1929 would have been severe in any case. However, nothing like the Great Depression that eventually ensued would have been possible without years of relentlessly tight monetary policy, reflected in a prolonged decline in the M2 money stock".
- Friedman, on how conducting monetary policy by managing interest rates contributed to both inflation and economic instability:
	- "the Fed continued to target interest rates, […] rather than monetary aggregates, and continued to adjust its interest rate targets only slowly and belatedly to changing market pressure".
	- "The result was that the monetary aggregates tended on average to rise excessively, contributing to inflation. However, from time to time, the Fed was too slow in lowering, rather than in raising the Federal funds rate. The result was sharp deceleration in the monetary aggregates, and an economic recession".

	- "Table 1 quantifies this shift. Before 1990, the correlation between the two series is 0.56; since then, it is -0.43".![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.45.14 PM.png]]

- Equation of exchange reads: MV=PY;
	- "where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the aggregate nominal price level, and Y is real GDP". Rewritten as:
				m + v = p + y
	- "where lowercase variables denote the growth rates of the corresponding uppercase variables, this equation makes clear that changes in velocity, causing v≠0, will weaken the connections between money growth m, inflation p, and real GDP growth y".
- Figure 3 focuses on M2 velocity.![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.46.09 PM.png]]
	- "had remained remarkably stable throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, moved unexpectedly higher in the early 1990s. […] the earlier stability in M2 velocity never returned. After rising from 1992 through 1995, M2 velocity reversed course and has relentlessly declined ever since".
	- "These post-1990 movements in velocity […] clearly underlie the shift in money-output correlation, from positive to negative".

## The Quantity Theory Revisited
- "The quantity theory is in the first instance a theory of the demand for money".
- "Friedman re-expresses the equation of exchange by depicting velocity V not as a constant but as a function of a small set of variables:
		MV(rb,re,p,w,Y,u) = PY.
	rb and re are the expected return on bonds and equities, w is the ratio of capital to labour income, and as before, p and Y are the rate of inflation and the level of real income. […] Meanwhile, u is a composite index of geographical mobility and economic uncertainty".
- "Figure 4 redraws figure 2, with growth in real shift-adjusted M2 replacing growth in real M2 itself".![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.46.58 PM.png]]
	- "After 1990, […] the graph shows a much tighter relationship between real money and output growth".
	- "Table 1, again, helps to quantify".

- "Figure 6 then shows a remarkably tight relationship between real shift-adjusted M2 growth and real GDP growth extending from 1867".![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.47.10 PM.png]]
	- "Clearly visible in the graph is the deep monetary contraction that lies at the heart of Friedman and Schwartz's explanation of the Great Depression".
- "episodes of major inflation—most significantly those during World War II and the 1970s—are accompanied by rapid growth in the shift-adjusted money supply".
- "links between money growth and inflation are revealed much more clearly when multiyear moving averages of both series are compared".
	- "figure 8-10 plot three-, five-, and ten-year moving average of shift-adjusted nominal M2 growth and inflation".![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.48.30 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.48.41 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 8.50.44 PM.png]]
- "The message from this analysis, based on Friedman's monetary economics, is that the recent bulge in M2, if not reversed, will soon fuel higher inflation".

## What Happens Next?
- "'what happens next' depends crucially on what the Federal Reserve does next. As noted above, FOMC members have not systematically followed movement in M2 or any other measure of the money supply in many years".
- "The boom-bust pattern of the 1970s will reappear, with high and volatile inflation accompanies by another recession".
