Joe Slott and Keith Cook, two floor traders were interviewed.
In comparison, Linda Raschke (an upstairs trader) was interviewed.
The article was published on 8 December, 1995

- Slott: (a.k.a SLOT)
	- Has studied fundamental and technical analysis for years but is philosophical about their importance to his day-to-day work
	- "The truth is, whatever analysis I do is pretty irrelevant. Over 90% of my income doesn't require charts or analysis. I'm just reacting to the order flow. That's the bulk of the typical local's income"
- Cook: (a.k.a RISK)
	- Describes himself as a "true scalper"
	- Sometimes adds on to winners, but never losers, and gets flat by the end of each day
	- Has consulted charts in the past, but now considers them a crutch that can bias trading, causing you to hang on to a loser because you think the market will obey a technical support or resistance level
- Raschke:
	- Ignores fundamentals and concentrates on short-term pattern recognition and catching two- to three- day price swings, varying her entries and exits during "buy" or "sell" days
	- "It's bad to flip through charts during the day. I try to look at quotes, otherwise I'll start playing"
