## <u>Chapter 1: Introduction</u>
- "Over the last 20 years, investors have increasingly come to regard investing in stocks about the same as putting money in the bank—except they got a higher return".
- "knowledge can be communicated but wisdom has to be self-taught".
- "This book is designed to upgrade investors' knowledge with the basics of how to make investment decisions, with particular reference to bear markets, bull market corrections and recessions".
- "This book discusses past models based on technical analysis and chart reading, plus similar economic, political, war, and social conditions".

# Part 1: The Bear Background

## <u>Chapter 2: Overwiew</u>
-   "define bear markets in three categories":
	1. "Baby bear such as those we have seen during the last 20 years, which were little more than secondary reactions within a papa bull trend".
	2. "Mama bear markets such as we saw in 1973-74".
	3. "Papa bear markets such as the one from 1929 to 1942 and, in constant dollar terms, from 1966 to 1981. Within these major bear markets, it is possible to have mini and medium size bull markets".
-   "You should be able to change from a bull to a bear or a bear to a bull, as conditions change, and not be the least inconsistent".
-   "a proper bear is someone who used to a bull but became a bear as conditions changed".
- "Joseph Kennedy, father of JFK, for example, made his family's fortune by short selling in the bear market that began in 1929. And many lesser known tycoons of the roaring twenties simply sold all their stocks and took a multi-year vacation, beginning around 1928".
- "most government intervention is of little help and over the long term usually makes a situation worse. There are always 'unintended consequences' to all government interference in an economy or market".
-   "as a bull market often goes too high, so too does a bear market go too low".
-   "one should form the habit of automatically being skeptical".

## <u>Chapter 3: History of Bear Markets</u>
- "we list all bear markets for the last 100 years. […] apply the models of history to current and future conditions, using not just market history, but the history of social, political, and economic events for the 20th century".
- "In Europe, where capital preservation is of a higher priority than a quick profit, they are in the habit of 'taking a view'. […] In America, all bear markets tend to be given equal ranking, with no consideration to the bigger picture. But that limited view is not particularly helpful for the longer term investor".
- "1929 to 1942, and from 1966 to 1982. Both periods were times when there were major economic and monetary problems that took well over a decade to resolve. Both periods were mirror images of what we have experienced between 1982 and 2000".
- "the investor who 'took a view' would have known that October 1987 was not the time to sell".
	- "if the same long-term investor has looked at the underlying financial and economic structure in the late 1960s, he would have seen that not only was there a 'bubble' mentality in electronics stocks, but that there were profound fiscal problems which were eating away at the economic health of American companies".
- "This doesn't mean that one should have gotten out of stocks in early 1929 or 1966 and taken a holiday from the stock market for the next decade […]. Instead, it means that when your 'taking a view' indicators tell you that there are major economic and monetary problems that are likely to take a year or more to be resolved, you no longer can buy and hold, but should become a more watchful and flexible investor, playing the major upmoves, but doing so with one hand on the exit all the way up".
- "The major bull market in the 1930s, and the two major bull markets during the 1970s, did not herald and end to the underlying monetary problems. Quite the reverse. In all cases, it was the lack of solution to the underlying health of the economy that pulled the market back down".
- An example of wrongful thinking is "the comparison of 1987 to the crash phase of 1929. Many people believe the Federal Reserve single-handedly prevented 1987 from becoming another 1929".
	- "Those investors who, in 1987, believed they were seeing a rerun of 1929 came to two different and equally wrong conclusions. One group believed that 1987 was the beginning of a 1930s-style bear market […]. The other group saw the Federal Reserve as a kind of latter-day Merlin, capable of creating permanent prosperity out of a potential 1929 situation".
- #quote_general_gyaan "ever more reliance on computers causes people to think ever less. And investing requires thinking. It is not a lazy man's hobby".

- "has been a bear market every 4 years on average".
- "percentage of decline in bear markets ranges from as little as 13.9% up to 90%. […] The averages mask a greater percentage fall by the majority of stocks not in the averages".
- "the depressed psychological climate at bear market bottoms prevents the majority from investing at the best time, […] by the time the majority of investors recognize a bull market is present, it is half-gone".
- "Everybody needs a plan, one that includes strategies for selling as well as buying—and (once understood) for selling short when that seems to be the prudent course of action".
- "After each of the 21 bear markets prior to 1987, prices did not immediately zoom back to new high ground. […] Most of those 21 bear markets took many months or even years to get back to where they were before the fall".
- "it is probably that the only way to avoid odds that are little different from red and black in roulette, is to play both sides of the wheel (i.e., willing to hold stocks long or short (or both) as circumstances warrant). […] Be flexible and trust your instincts".

# Part 2: Economic Setting For Bear Markets

## <u>Chapter 4: Guideposts for Bear Markets</u>
- "During the latter part of the 1990s, […] data was used selectively […] Wall Street became part of the entertainment industry".
	- "they were and are expected to entertain viewers and readers, and to put a positive spin on all economic and financial data, no matter how dire it is in reality".
- "Until about 1995, technical indicators usually had a few weeks lag time before the data manifested themselves in the markets. And the connection between economic conditions and stock market direction was still accepted as fact".
	- "But, from about 1995 on, the media and governments have manipulated all data so much that the average investor today believes that, provided the Federal Reserve and US government cut interest rates or create bail-out packages, it won't be long before the great bull market of the 1990s resumes".
- Signs a bull market is ending
	-   "bull markets cannot be sustained if the economy is faltering".
	1.  "The most important indictor […] when investor sentiment is still bullish while the underlying economic structure continues to weaken".
	2.  "Price earnings ratios". Above average P/E ratios.
	3.  "The Federal Reserve. Fed action has been the most closely watched indicator in the last 5 years. […] it is increasingly clear that when the US economy goes south, there is little government can do to stop it".
	4.  "There is always an abundance of confidence in the future of business and the market, at peaks. Even after markets turn down, as long as that confidence remains high the bear market has further to go".
	5.  "In times of uncertainty, the interest in gold and gold shares pick up".
	6.  "There is usually a lot of public speculation in real estate at bull market tops. […] In inflationary bear markets, real estate is seen as a haven and prices rise. In bear markets where inflation is low and the currency firm, real estate will usually stay firm in the early stages, but will decline as the bear market deepens".
	7.  "Stock market action. At tops, there is […] 'churning' (i.e., high volume but not much change in prices, or great irregularity in prices, plus a lot of volatility day to day)".
	8.  "Unanimity of bullish forecasts. Business leaders, brokers, advisory services, columnists and broadcasters are, in the main, bullish. Any downturn is dismissed as temporary".
	9.  "Sharp rise in debt. […] Consumer debt, household debt service payments, losses by credit card issuers, bankruptcy filings and mortgage delinquencies all rise sharply".
	-   "this list changes constantly".
- Fads as a leading indicator for the end of a bull market
	- "All major bull market of the last 100 years were fueled by new technology".
	- "Both fads and new technological advances look much the same on the surface. Experience brings the ability to tell the difference between 'the sizzle and the steak'".
	- "Fads are a major indicator that a bull market is reaching a bubble stage".
- Signs a bear market is ending
	1. "Bad news abundant".
	2. "Credit. Still tight. […] Large holdings in bonds and other cash-related investments".
	3. "Stock Market. Volume low, not much interest. […] high [earnings] yields. […] Some key stocks begin to show good rally potential".
	4. "Confidence. Nil. Pessimistic forecasts made for the market and for business".
	5. "Real Estate. Unless it has been an inflationary bear market, real estate prices will be down. It is hard to sell property. Lots of empty commercial buildings. Rents reduced. Foreclosures rise".
	6. "Bonds. Government bond buying is popular. Corporate bonds are high, yields low".
- Three bear phases (Robert Shea)
	1. "abandonment of hopes upon which the uprush of the preceding bull market was predicated".
	2. "reflection of the decreased earning power and reduction of dividend".
	3. "distress liquidation of securities which must be sold to meet living expenses".
	-  "Each of these phases seems to be divided by a secondary reaction which is often erroneously assumed to be the beginning of a bull market".
- Watch your emotions
	- "hold a strong rein on yourself, otherwise your emotions or prejudices of the moment (be they bullish or bearish) will cause you to read the total situation as bullish or bearish on the basis of selective evidence".
- Be first
	- "Don’t expect to see too many signs occur at once. They show up over a period of perhaps many months".
	- "don't imagine that markets turn on dimes and change direction overnight, as the mass media would have you believe"
- Business indicators
	- "Many accepted leading indicators are lagging or coincident indicators, so, if you want to stay ahead of the crowd, you need take note of those indicators as soon as the facts are known".
	- "The best way to use these indicators is not to create some mathematical model on your computer […] but to develop an internal model in your head".
- The effects of globalization
	- "You may have no interest in investing outside your own country. But you cannot affort to ignore what is happening in other countries".

## <u>Chapter 5: Globalization, Terrorism, and Foreign Investment</u>
- "globalization is too far advanced to be reversed by terrorism".
- "what moves markets over the medium and long term are the underlying economics".
- "There are some foreign investments that come into their own in bear markets. And, in come kinds of bear market, you can make more money investing abroad than you can make investing domestically".
- "If you have little knowledge of a country, study their market charts. Charts are knowledge".
- "Some of the best gold mining companies are not American, but Canadian, Australian, or South African".
- "gold mining shares are often a more attractive buy in the early stages of a bear market, particularly an inflationary bear market".
- "Another reason to invest abroad during a bear market is if you fear inflation will erode the value of your own currency".


# Part 3: Structure of Bear Markets

## <u>Chapter 6: Secondary Reactions</u>
- "The secondary reaction gives us a chance to 'bail out' at higher prices. It also gives an opportunity for shorting".
- "the termination of a bear market led and the beginning of a rally cannot always be spotted by volume indications alone".
	- "after an extended bear market decline, there will be a day or two of high volume. If the decline then continues but volume shrinks drastically, the odds favor an early reversal".
- "Reactions (whether in bull or bear markets) nearly always consume less time and are more violent than are movements in the direction of the primary trend".
- "bear market secondaries, […] often present a bouncing or turn-on-a-dime appearance; the rallies seem to spring from no visible base or area of support".
	- "Bear market reactions invariably result from a technical condition in which the market becomes oversold".
- #quote_price_action "Dullness following the peak of a bear market rally is a common danger sign".
	- "the action of the market after dullness depends chiefly upon whether a bull or bear market is in progress".
- "it's best to move in and out of the market in conjunction with secondary movements".
- "A secondary [reaction] can be as little as 10% and much as 99.9%".
	- "careful analysis shows that 7% of all reactions terminate after retracting 40-55%, 27% after retracing 55 to 70%, 8% after retracing 70 to 85%, with 14% of all secondary movements extending beyond 85% retracement".
- "If you would be successful during bear markets, when those around you are losing their shirts, learn the signs of the secondary".


## <u>Chapter 7: Bear Market Legs</u>
- "a bit easier to define legs (or phases) of bear markets than of bull markets because they are more compressed in time, more sharp in movement, more dramatic. Yet, despite this, most people react to teach secondary reaction as though it were the end of the bear market".
- "A bear market can  usually be broken into three legs or phases, and each of these in turn can be broken into three smaller legs, and each of those in turn into three. The major legs are rationalized as follows:"
	1. "when the euphoric expectations of unrealistically high stock prices are abandoned".
	2. "when more stocks are sold based on decreased economic conditions, decreased earnings, a rise in unemployment, etc.".
	3. "when people cash out their stocks because their income has decreased so much that they simply need the money".
- Each down-leg in a bear market ends, "almost without exception, on less volume than the volume" the crash began with.
	- "with the coming of the 1969 bear market, the pattern changed somewhat […]. In all bear markets since, the decrease in volume, while noticeable, was far less pronounced than it had been in prior bear markets"
	- #quote_price_action "In fact, the best way one was sure that the last bear leg had been seen was the sudden rise in volume while prices also rose".
- "Statistically, it has been pretty well proven that major bear markets all have a minimum of two legs and potentially from three to eight".
	- "The crash of 1929 had, so far, the greatest number of legs of all bear markets in history: eight".
- "By studying legs, one gets a better idea of where you are and what may lie ahead".
- "even after only a single bear leg down, you should start watching (à la 1987). After two bear legs, you should be much more alert, and after three legs, you can begin to anticipate a reversal with growing conviction".
- "when prices fall lower than the last decline and then rise but fail to reach the last rally high, you must take the position that a downtrend is under way.

## <u>Chapter 8: Tools to Help You Recognize and Survive a Bear Market</u>
- The fundamental approach "does not detract from the technical approach, which generally can paint a bigger and more time-related picture. Many people use both".
- The Fundamental Approach
	- "If you rely only on fundamentals, you <i>never</i> know whether you have all the necessary facts to make an informed judgement. Some are purposely hidden, withheld, or delayed".
- The Technical Approach
	- "you know that what you know about a specific index reading is all there is to know. There is no more. Nobody can con you and you can be sure nothing has gotten by you. The price is the price".
	- "my best advice is to use a number of tried and true tools. Examine each new one as it comes along. […] That way you come to have a 'feel' for the way each one handles in every kind of market".
	- "it's best to use as many indicators, or tools, as you can handle. But make sure you really understand them".
	- "as you gain experience with your tools, you will learn when to listen to them and when to ignore some of them".
	- #tool_technical_analysis Technical tools that can be used for market timing:
		1. Advance-decline line.
			- "By subtracting the daily number of advances from declines (or declines from advances) and subtracting (or adding) that difference from a running cumulative total (from an arbitrary starting figure)".
			- "Observe the way in which it diverges from the averages for the best clues".
		2. New highs-new lows.
			- "Total the last 5 days of the daily new highs; divide by five. […] Do same the for the lows".
			- "Observe whether the highs remain on top during a reaction that has interrupted a major upswing. (If not, it's usually fatal to the upswing.) And vice versa".
		3. Odd-lot balance index.
			- "odd lotters buy less than 100 shares".
			- "Divide the daily odd-lot purchases total into the daily odd-lot sales. Totals above 100% show the small investor selling more shares than he buys".
			- "The only readings of significance are the changes of percent, not the switch from sell to buy or buy to sell. A move from 70 to 90% is as important as from 95% to 115%".
		4. Odd-lot trading ratio.
			- "Add daily odd-lot sales and purchases together. Divide that figure by total market volume for the day. Then, cut your answer in half".
			- "The result is a figure between 7 and 13%. 10% is normal. Below that is bullish. Above 10% is bearish".
		5. Odd-lot short sales index.
			- "should be kept daily, and as a 10-day moving average, where it is most accurate".
		6. Volume.
			- "there is probably nothing more important to measure and understand".
			- Joseph Granville on Volume (book: *A Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing for Maximum Profit*)
				- "The first series of declines in a bear market may be accomplished on light volume and this must be bearishly interpreted simply because the quality of leadership will be excellent on the downside".
				- "As the decline becomes more rapid, the public gets more and more frightened and now stocks are being dumped. This sends the volume still higher and a 'selling climax' results".
				- "stress the fact that the most serious declines in stock market history usually started with what looked like a series of meaningless light volume declines; at least the public though they were meaningless. The quality of leadership was the key".
			- Dow on Volume
				- "Dullness usually runs to advance in a bull market and into decline in a bear market".
			- Gartley on Volume
				- "bear market cycles begin on reduced volume. As the major (downward) phase develops, volume increases and this phase ends in a selling climax on heavy volume".
				- "The ensuing rally (corrective phase) is accompanied by declining volume, which dwindles until the rally loses momentum completely, and the major trend is resumed in a new bear cycle. … Bear market rallies start out of active selling climaxes".
		7. DJIA 30-week moving average.
		8. Overbought-oversold index.
			- "Quite popular is the 10-day moving average of the difference between advances and declines".
			- "some stocks/commodities are more responsive to this (or any tool) than others. If you track their history, you'll find such varying sensitivity of great help".
		9. Confidence index.
			- "Barron's Confidence Index […] represents the ratio between the yield on high-risk and low-risk bonds and supposedly shows the thinking of the elite money minds".
			- "I have made a 5-week and a 10-week moving average of it".
		10. Short interest.
			- "must be used in conjunction with the Short Interest Ratio".
			- "Arbitrage disfigures short interest".
			- "the total short interest monthly direction is contrary to truth 'if' you subtract the arbitrage shorts".
		11. The short interest ratio.
			- "measures the market volume against the shorts, once a month".
			- If ratio > 2%, it's bullish; if it's <1%, it's bearish.
		12. Brokers' free credit balance index.
			- "The amount of money (credit) held in customer's accounts is latent buying power".
			- "Customers tend to use up more of this credit cash as a bull market is reaching its top. They tend to let more of this money stand idle during the first half of a bull run because they aren't convinced yet".
		13.  Debit balances index.
			- "represents the money owed to brokers in margin accounts".
			- "represents the shrewder traders".
			- "tends to rise in during the first two stages of bull markets. It generally tops out in the last portion of a bull market and drops steadily through the bear market following".
		14. Nasdaq indexes.
			- "reflects the more speculative aspects of Wall Street, and no bull market can long exist unless or until the speculative element is active".
			- "likely to top out and go into a sustained decline before the Dow Industrials, as happened during 2000".
			- #idea_technical_analysis Create an index of your own constituting the stocks that are most speculative. Stock-picking will be mostly fundamentally driven and partly technically driven".
		15. Resistance index.
			- "If the market is up (as measured by the DJIA), subtract the advances (total issues advancing) from the issues traded. Then, divide the figure by the total issues traded. If the market is down, do the same thing using the declines instead of the advances".
			- "shows the level of resistance to whatever the market is doing".
		16. #idea_technical_analysis Leadership index.
			- "The average price of the daily volume leaders shows the kind of leadership the market is enjoying".
			- "If this tends to fall on upswings or rise on downswings, it's bearish".
			- "hardly anyone follows it anymore, which makes it work better".
		17. Percent of advances index.
			- "Divide the daily advances by the issues traded".
			- "A 10-day moving average is probably best".
			- "another way approaching the overbought-oversold problem".
		18. Gold shares index.
			- "If you are an active investor or trader, you need this on a daily basis".
			- "you can create your own by positing the prices of at least six gold shares into a composite index".
			- "Compare the net change each time [of a Gold index, such as Gold-Bug index, Toronto gold index, Financial Times gold index, and South African gold index] with the net change of the Dow Jones Industrials".
			- "If they both rise together, it's bearish, especially if the gold's net change is large".
	- Author's favorite indices
		- 1. DJIA 10-day moving average of internal volume.
			- "total the volume of all the Dow stocks that rose, and those that fell, separately. Make a 10-day moving average of the plus-volume and also the minus-volume. Subtract these totals daily".
		2. DJIA resistance.
			- "Similar to [DJIA 10-day moving average of internal volume] but limited only those DJIA stocks that were unchanged. This volume is posted on a daily basis, not a 10-day moving average".
		3. DJIA volume ratio.
			- "volume of all DJIA stocks. Divide that figure by the volume for the market as a whole".
			- "a high ratio is usually bullish, a low ratio bearish".
		4. Advance-decline 200-day line.
			- "Same principle as 200-dayline for the DJIA or any stock"
		5. Nasdaq volume leaders.
			- "Record the plus and minus action of the top five Nasdaq most active stocks".
			- "giving a bullish signal on the first day (in many weeks) that it records five consecutive pluses and a bear market signal on the first five minuses".
		-   "In general, I do not use indexes based on the Russell, or Wilshire, because these are not average most investors watch".
	- "At the September 1929 peak, the DJIA average yield was 3.3%. At the crash low, 2 months later, the yield was 5.2%".
	- "You can't know when yields are too high, or too low. But, if you are constantly aware of whether yields are 'relatively high' (or low), you will keep your mind in a constant state of alert, so that stock action will fit into perspective and won't surprise you".
	- "Learning to see or feel the relationships of the indicators or to sense the background against which they are 'talking' at any given moment is the art of real stock market analysis".

## <u>Chapter 9: Tools that 'Change Shape' in Bear Markets</u>
- Indicators act differently in bear markets than in bull.
- "bear markets tend to last a third to half as long as their preceding bull market".
- "the shorts [measured by short interest] are not to be looked at as a big support factor in bear times [as they are in bull times]".

## <u>Chapter 10: Cycles Study: A Useful Market Tool?</u>
- "there are some very good market analysts who use Elliott Wave Theory, Fibonacci number series, and even Astrology to predict where markets might go next".

## <u>Chapter 11: Chart Reading and Interpretation</u>
- "Because Charles Dow designed [Dow] theory as a forecaster of business, not a predictor of stock action, confirmation of signals tend to coincident or trailing, not leading".
- "The trick in the stock market has never been what stock to buy or sell or sell short, but *when*. That's where charts come to the rescue".

# Part 5: Money-Making Tactics

## <u>Chapter 12: Preservation of Capital during a Bear Market</u>
- "Solvency is entirely a matter of temperament and not of income".
- "Preservation of capital is primary. Profits are acutely important but secondary, and, before you make any investment decision, you should first ascertain the risk inherent in that investment vehicle".
- "Winning in the market is largely a matter of fighting a battle within yourself. Intellectual domination of your emotions will win the day, if it is indeed won".
- "To hold something both long and short is a common practice with many sophisticated investors. If you feel you know charts well enough to pick the strong stocks to hold long and the weak ones to hold short, this is a reasonable approach as you are balanced and invested with the individual stock trends".
- "Selling short as soon as prices start to dip is much safer".
- In the late stage of a bear market, buy "low-priced stocks or, if you want to be more conservative, the low-priced medium-quality stocks. […] Watch for 'relative strength' of individual stocks and groups".
- "the most important tactic in any kind of market anywhere is to get rid of your weakest investments, hold your strongest, cut your losses quickly, use stops, and leave you better-acting securities alone".

## <u>Chapter 13: Short Selling 101</u>
- "I generally stick to shorting blue chips".
- Requirements for a good short:
	- "had a large rise in recent weeks or months—preferably, an emotional rise not founded on reality".
	- "The rise was on increase volume".
	- "seems to have stopped rising'.
	- "shows a top area of distribution (large volume at the top, but unable to rise any higher) and recently has started 'breaking down' (falling below the top area)".
	- "has not declined more than 10-15% from its secondary peak as yet".
	- "has an abnormally high P/E ratio".
	- "has a relatively low short interest".
	- "Avoid stocks too thinly capitalized".
	- "It's desirable if a stock has risen to heavy overhead supply, and ideally to a point where it broke support earlier".
- "When you are short, remember that rallies in bear markets are traditionally sharp, which means they can be frightening to bear positions".
- "It is wise to plan ahead in the matter of selection of stocks to be shorted when the time is right". Watch for relative weakness. "Use Stochastics to help your timing—it measures overbought and oversold conditions".

## <u>Chapter 14: Strategies for Making Money Even if You Guess Wrong</u>
- "whether you make money at all, or, more importantly, don't lose much when you guess wrong, depends purely on the tactics you use".
- "Even if technical tools or fundamentals fail you, your tactics can save you".
- If you're looking to short sell a stock, look on the chart and place a sell order just below the downtrend line. "be sure the stock does not show a 'reversal pattern'".
	- Place a stop-loss order the same day you get filled on your short trade.
	- "change the stop-loss order as needed, based on the new level of the trend line".
- "The best way to begin using this method is to use it for a single stock at a time".
- "Avoid taking a position if you are in grave doubt about the market as a whole".
- Track the individual stock short interest ratio; "the stock's total number of shares outstanding and subtract all the shares you know to be held by funds and institutions […] divide the latest short interest figure in that stock (multiplied by 100) by the remaining shares outstanding".
- "As a loose rule of thumb, if the stock is trading less shares in a week than its short interest, the gearing is powerfully bullish".
- "By picking a stock that is part of an upward (or downward if you are shorting) moving group [industry], you get the odds working for you to a considerably higher degree".
- "To make money, you must have no pride of opinion. You must care only about making profits and not hesitate for one second to admit you made a mistake, and reverse your direction from forward to back or back to forward".
- Summary
	- "Select a high volume stock with a sharp trend line.
	- Stick to one stock.
	- Change stop losses.
	- Trade short or long.
	- When in doubt, stay out.
	- Check the short interest.
	- Forget pride of opinion".

## <u>Chapter 15: Rules for Being a Flexible Investor</u>
- Flexible investing "requires what used to be called having a 'trader's mentality' of the market. […] mean being pliable, alert, and willing to get out of things quickly, and usually aiming at shorter-term profits".
- "I am not suggesting that you become a day trader. Merely that you watch your investments closely on a daily (if possible) or weekly basis, through the eyes of the market indicators in this book".
- #quote_regime "There are times when buying a stock that's already high—on a chart breakout, out of a consolidation pattern—is proper. Likewise, there are times when buying a stock at a new low price is proper—if accompanied by a chart that reflects accumulation or the ends of a downswing".

## <u>Chapter 16: Defensive Investments that Allow You to Sleep Nights</u>
- "You should examine political, economic, and monetary data to decide what sort of recession and/or bear market is likely to evolve over the next few months, or years:"
	- "short and sharp à la 1987 or 1990, where the underlying economic and financial infrastructure won't be damaged very much if at all".
	- "inflationary recession as we saw in the 1970s? A recession that may not be very deep, but will be protracted because it cannot end until inflation is squeezed out of the economy".
	- "deflationary, or just disinflationary? No matter what government does to create liquidity, if it is countered by business and consumers who spend less in an anxiety-ridden environment, government efforts will fail".
- Bonds and cash-equivalent investments
	- "Unless you believe that inflation will rapidly increase to 5% or more, having a major portion of your portfolio in bonds and bank accounts at interest is prudent".
	- "In an inflationary environment, bonds still have their place. During the 1970s, for example, while the dollar was suffering from high inflation, the Swiss franc and the German mark were not. Many Americans chose to put money into Swiss and German bonds and bank account at interest, and made considerable profits".
- Real estate
	- "Unless high inflation occurs in a recession, investment real estate should be liquidated or cur back".
	- "if the rate of inflation suddenly speeds up while business is slowing down, real estate will become a way to preserve value. In an inflationary bear market, real estate is a major defensive investment".
- Tangible assets
	- "In an inflationary recession, if you own a stamp or coin collection of value, jewelry, rare stones, antiques art, old cars, or a warehouse full of merchandise, hang on. Their value is likely to increase much more than the increase in inflation. But if the recession is deflationary, all the above would decrease in value".
- Gold
	- Gold bullion, gold mining shares, and gold coins rise in times of uncertainty "whether the climate is deflationary or inflationary, though gold usually rises more during times of inflation than deflation".
