## <u>Chapter 1: Introduction</u>
- "every asset characteristic corresponds to a particular portfolio"
- Want high residual return and low residual risk. "in a mean/variance style through residual return minus a (quadratic) penalty on residual risk (a linear penalty on residual variance)"
- Fundamental law of active management: Sources of investment opportunity are
	1. Ability to forecast asset's residual return — Information coefficient: correlation between forecasts and the eventual returns
	2. Breadth — number of times per year we can use our skill $$\text{IR} = \text{IC}\ \cdot \ \sqrt{\text{breadth}} $$
- "forecasting takes raw signals of asset returns and turns them into refined forecasts". Rule of thumb: $$\text{Alpha} = \text{volatility} \ \cdot \ \text{IC} \ \cdot \ \text{score}$$
	- $\text{score} =$ standardised ($0$ mean and $1$ stdev)
	- $\text{Alpha} =$ a forecast of residual return
	- $\text{volatility} =$ residual volatility
	- $\text{IC} =$ correlation b/w scores and returns

# Part One: Foundations

## <u>Chapter 2: Consensus Expected Returns: CAPM</u>
- "One of the valuable by-products of the CAPM is a procedure for determining consensus expected returns"
- "The active manager can succeed to the extent that his or her forecasts are superior to the CAPM consensus forecasts"
- "CAPM is about expected returns, not risk"
- "historical returns contain a large amount of standard error"
	- "Given returns generated by an unvarying random process with known annual standard deviation $\sigma$, the standard error of the estimated annual return will be $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{Y}}$, where $Y$ measures the number of years of data"
- APT "is an interesting tool for the active manager, but not as a source of *consensus* expected returns"
- market portfolio = consensus portfolio, and the CAPM leads to the expected returns which market the market mean/variance optimal
- Beta is a forecast of the future.
- "Historical beta is a reasonable forecast of the betas that be realised in the future, although it is possible to do better"
	- "There is a tendency for betas to regress toward the mean"
	- "forecasts of betas based on the fundamental attributes of the company, rather than its returns over the past, say, 60 months, turn out to be much better forecasts of future betas"
- Return and variance of a portfolio: $$ r_p = \beta_p r_M + \theta_p \tag{2.3} $$ $$ \sigma^2_p = \beta^2_p \sigma^2_M + \omega^2_p \tag{2.4} $$where, $\omega^2_p$ is the residual variance of the portfolio $p$, i.e. the variance of $\theta_p$
- CAPM states $\mathbb{E}[\theta_p] = 0$. That means $\mathbb{E}[r_p] = \beta_p \mu_M$
	- Implicit: "all investors have the same expectation, and differ only in their tolerance for risk"
- "given any portfolio defined as optimal, the expected returns to all other portfolios will be proportional to their betas with respect to that optimal portfolio"
- "The ability to decompose return and risk into market and residual components depends on our ability to forecast betas"
- "There is no need to forecast the expected excess market return $\mu_M$ if you control beta. The manager can focus research on forecasting residual returns"
- #### Problems and Appendix: ![[Chapter 2.pdf]]

## <u>Chapter 3: Risk</u>
- Assuming correlation between the returns of all pairs of stocks is equal to $\rho$, risk of an equally weighted portfolio of stocks each with risk $\sigma$ is $$ \sigma_P = \sigma\ \cdot\ \sqrt{\frac{1 + \rho\ \cdot\ (N-1)}{N}} \tag{3.4} $$In the limit, as number of stocks increase $$ \sigma_P \to \sigma\ \cdot\ \sqrt{\rho} \tag{3.5} $$
- <u>Active risk</u>: difference between the manager's portfolio's return $r_P$ and the benchmark's return $r_B$. Define active risk $\Psi$ as $$ \Psi_P = \text{Std}\{r_{PA}\} = \text{Std}\{r_P - r_B\}  \tag{3.7} $$
- <u>Residual risk</u>: risk of the return orthogonal to the systematic return. Residual risk of portfolio $P$ relative to benchmark $B$ is $$ \omega_P = \sqrt{\sigma^2_P - \beta^2_P\ \cdot\ \sigma^2_B} \tag{3.8} $$
- "The cost of risk equates risk to an equivalent loss in expected return"
- #### Elementary Risk Models
	- "The goal of a risk model is to accurately and efficiently forecast the covariance matrix. The challenge arises because the covariance matrix contains so many independent quantities". Covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{V}$ $$ \boldsymbol{V} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2_1 & \sigma_{12} & \cdots & \sigma_{1N} \\ \sigma_{12} & \sigma^2_2 \\ \vdots &  & \ddots \\ \sigma_{1N} & & & \sigma^2_N \end{bmatrix} \tag{3.10} $$
	1. Single factor diagonal model: market risk and residual risk
		- precursor to CAPM, but different. CAPM assumed equilibrium but not that all residual returns are uncorrelated.
		- analyse returns as $$ r_n = \beta_n \cdot r_M + \theta_n \tag{3.11} $$
		- assumes that residual returns $\theta_n$ are uncorrelated, and hence $$\text{Cov}(r_n,r_m) = \text{Cov}(\beta_n \cdot r_M + \theta_n\ ,\ \beta_m \cdot r_M + \theta_m\ ) $$ $$ \text{Cov}\{r_n,r_m\} = \beta_n \cdot \beta_m \cdot \sigma^2_M \tag{3.12} $$and $$ \sigma^2_n = \beta^2_n \cdot \sigma^2_M + \omega^2_n \tag{3.13} $$
		- residual returns are correlated. Market-weighted average residual returns is exactly zero $$ \sum_n h_M(n) \cdot \theta_n = 0  \tag{3.14} $$Therefore, residual correlation between stocks must be in general negative.
	2. A model that assumes all pairs of stocks have the same correlation
		- Correlation between stocks is $\rho$. That means each covariance between any two stocks is $$ \text{Cov}\{r_n,r_m\} = \sigma_n \cdot \sigma_m \cdot \rho \tag{3.15} $$
		- "can be helpful in some 'quick and dirty' applications"
		- "ignores the subtle linkage between stocks in similar industries and firms with common attributes"
	3. Full covariance model based on historical returns
		- relies on historical variances and covariances; neither robust nor reasonable
		- rely on data from $T$ periods to estimate the $N \times N$ covariance matrix. "If $T$ is less than or equal to $N$, we can find active positions that will appear riskless"
- #### Structured Risk Models
	- By identifying important factors, we can reduce the size of the problem. Instead of dealing with 6000 stocks, we deal with 68 factors.
	- Stocks change, factors do not. Focus on the small number of factors and allow the stocks to change their exposures to those factors.
	- <u>returns</u> of a stock: stock's excess returns, exposure to factors, attributed factor returns, and the specific returns $$ r_n(t) = \sum_k X_{n,k}(t) \cdot b_k(t) + u_n(t)  \tag{3.16} $$where,
	  $r_n(t) =$ the return above risk-free return for stock $n$ during the period from time $t$ to $t+1$
	  $X_{n,k} =$ exposure of asset $n$ to factor $k$, estimated at time $t$; a.k.a. *factor loadings*; often standardized so that the average exposure over all stocks is $0$ and stdev is $1$
	  $b_k(t) =$ factor return to factor $k$ during the period from time $t$ to $t+1$
	  $u_n(t) =$ stock $n$'s specific return during the period from time $t$ to $t+1$; cannot be explained by the factors; a.k.a. *idiosyncratic return*
	  The exposures are known at time $t$ and the asset returns, factor returns, and specific returns span the period from time $t$ to time $t+1$
	- Assuming specific returns are not correlated with factor returns and are not correlated with each other, the <u>risk structure</u> is $$ V_{n,m} = \sum_{k_1,k_2 = 1}^K X_{n,k_1} \cdot F_{k_1,k_2} \cdot X_{m,k_2} + \Delta_{n,m} \tag{3.17} $$where,
	  $V_{n,m}=$ covariance of asset $n$ with asset $m$
	  $X_{n,k_1}=$ exposure to asset $n$ to factor $k_1$
	  $F_{k_1,k_2}=$ covariance of factor $k_1$ with factor $k_2$
	  $\Delta_{n,m} =$ specific covariance of asset $n$ with asset $m$. We assume that all specific return correlations are zero, and so this term is zero, unless $n=m$
- #### Choosing the Factors
	- Macro-factors: estimation through regression analysis or similar technique causes too many errors; backward-looking in nature; poor data quality
	- Cross-sectional: attributes of stocks
		- fundamental and market
		- quite powerful factors
	- Statistical: PCA, Maximum Likelihood analysis, expectations maximization analysis
		- "We usually avoid statistical factors, because they are very difficult to interpret"
		- "cannot capture factors whose exposures change over time"
		- "assumes and relies on each asset's constant exposure to each factor over the estimation period"
	- Two broad categories of factors: *industry factors* and *risk indices*
	- ##### Industry factors
		- Industry exposures are usually $0/1$ variables
		- Since large corporations can do business in several industries, we can extend the industry factors to account for membership in multiple industries
	- ##### Risk indices
		- Categories:
			- *Volatility*
			- *Momentum*
			- *Size*
			- *Liquidity*
			- *Growth*
			- *Value*
			- *Earnings volatility*
			- *Financial leverage*
		- Each category typically contain several specific measurements, called *descriptors*. Construct risk index exposures by weighting the exposures of the descriptors within the index. "We choose the weights that maximise the explanatory and predictive power of the model"
		- Rescale all raw exposure data: $$ x_{\text{normalised}} = \frac{x_{\text{raw}} - \mu_{\text{raw}}}{\text{Std}[x_{\text{raw}}]} \tag{3.18} $$
- #### Structured Risk Model Covariance
	- Look at the Appendix for the estimation of factor returns and specific returns
- #### Uses of a Risk Model
	- measures overall risk; more significantly, it decomposes that risk in several ways
	- "can also perform marginal analysis: What assets are most and least diversifying in the portfolio, at the margin"
	- Chapter 14 covers how risk models help in the design of future portfolios
	- Chapter 17 covers how risk models help in evaluating the past performance of the portfolio

## <u>Chapter 4: Exceptional Return, Benchmarks, and Value Added</u>
- "CAPM provides consensus expected returns. A multiple-factor model can help to control risk"
- we can define $\boldsymbol{\beta}_n$ as $$r_n = \frac{\text{Cov}\{r_n,r_B\}}{\text{Var}\{r_B\}} \tag{4.1}$$
- Active holding in risky assets:$$\boldsymbol{h}_{PA} = \boldsymbol{h}_P - \boldsymbol{h}_B \tag{4.2} $$
- Active variance:$$\psi^2_P = \boldsymbol{h}^T_{PA} \cdot \boldsymbol{V} \cdot \boldsymbol{h}_{PA}$$
- #### Components of Expected Return
	- decompose expected return forecasts into four parts:
	- If $R_n$ is the total return on asset $n$: $$ \mathbb{E}\{R_n\} = 1 +\ i_F +\ \beta_n \cdot \mu_B +\ \beta_n \cdot \Delta f_B +\ \alpha_n  \tag{4.7} $$
	- $(i_F)$ : risk-free (time premium)
	- $(\beta_n \cdot \mu_B)$ : benchmark (risk premium)
		- borrowing from CAPM
		- $\mu_B$ estimated by analysts as a very long run (70+ years) average
	- $(\beta_n \cdot \Delta f_B)$ : benchmark timing (exceptional benchmark)
		- $\Delta f_B$ is the difference between the expected excess return on the benchmark in the near future and the long-run expected excess return
	- $(\alpha_n)$ : alpha (expected residual return)
		- expected residual return $\alpha_n = \mathbb{E}\{\theta_n\}$
	- With a list of expected returns $\mathbb{E}\{R_n\}$, asset betas $\beta_n$, weight of each asset in the benchmark $\boldsymbol{h}_B$, a risk-free rate $i_F$, and a long-run expected return on the benchmark, we can separate the expected returns into their component parts.
- express the forecast of expected excess return for stock $n$ as $$ f_n = \beta_n \cdot f_B + \alpha_n \tag{4.10} $$where $f_B$ = expected excess return for the benchmark, $\beta_n$ is stock's beta, and $\alpha_n$ is stock $n$'s forecast alpha.
- Expected utility $$U[P] = f_P - \lambda_T\ \cdot\ \sigma^2_P \tag{4.11} $$where $f_P$ is the expected return $\lambda_T\ \cdot\ \sigma^2_P$ is a penalty for risk
- Level of total risk aversion that would lead us to choose the benchmark portfolio $$ \lambda_T = \frac{\mu_B}{2 \cdot \sigma^2_B} \tag{4.12} $$
- Using (4.12) and defining $\Delta f_B = f_B - \mu_B$ to be the forecast of exceptional benchmark return, the beta of the portfolio $P$ becomes $$ \beta_P = 1 + \frac{\Delta f_B}{\mu_B} \tag{4.14} $$
- "In total risk/return analysis, small levels of information lead to very high levels of residual risk"
- #### Focus on Value-Added
	- The amount of value added by an active manger: $$\text{VA} = \{\beta_{PA} \cdot \Delta f_B - \lambda_{BT} \cdot \beta^2_{PA} \cdot \sigma^2_B \} + \{ \alpha_P - \lambda_R \cdot \omega^2_P \} \tag{4.15} $$i.e., Benchmark timing and residual position
	- The risk-aversion— $\lambda_{BT}$ for benchmark timing and $\lambda_{R}$ for residual risk— transforms the variance into a penalty deducted from the amount of expected returns.
- #### Active Versus Residual Returns
	- Residual return and risk are $$ \theta_P = r_P - \beta_P \cdot r_B  \tag{4.17} $$$$ \omega_P = \text{Std}\{\theta_P\} \tag{4.18} $$
	- Active return and risk are $$ r_{PA} = r_P - r_B = \theta_P + \beta_{PA} \cdot r_B \tag{4.19} $$$$ \psi_P = \text{Std}\{r_{PA}\} = \sqrt{\omega^2_P + \beta^2_{PA} \cdot \sigma^2_B} \tag{4.20} $$
	- "As long as the manager avoids benchmark timing and sets $\beta_P=1$, active and residual returns (and risks) are identical"
