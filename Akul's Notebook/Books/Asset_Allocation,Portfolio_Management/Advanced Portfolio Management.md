	- "market component of the stock return is also called the *systematic* return of a stock"
	- "The first term on the left is the intercept $\alpha$; it is a constant. When the market return is zero, the daily stock return is *in expectation* equal to alpha"
	- "The last term is the 'noise' around the stock return; it is also called *idiosyncratic* return of the stock"

- "estimates of alphas have large associated confidence intervals, and they seem to vary over time"
