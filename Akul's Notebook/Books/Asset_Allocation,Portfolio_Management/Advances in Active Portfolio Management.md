## <u>Chapter 1: Introduction: Advances in Active Portfolio Management</u>
- "The fundamental law of active management (...) shows that high information ratios require some winning combination of skill in making investment decisions; breadth of those decisions, for diversification; and efficiency of implementation, so that the portfolio accurately captures the manager's views".
- Section 1: "recaps *Active Portfolio Management*"
- Section 2: "covers advances in active portfolio management"
- Section 3: "covers applications of active portfolio management"
- "equation numbers and exhibit numbers begin anew with each chapter. Because the chapters began as independent articles, there is no referencing of equations in one chapter by another chapter."

## <u>Chapter 2: Introduction to the Recap of <i>Active Portfolio Management</i> section</u>
- articles that "recap some of the key elements of that predecessor book"
	1. "Seven Insights into Active Management" by Ronald N. Kahn
	2. "A Retrospective Look at the Fundamental Law of Active Management" by Richard C. Grinold and Ronald N. Kahn
	3. "Breadth, Skill, and Time" by Richard C. Grinold and Ronald N. Kahn
- "High information ratios follow from high levels of skill and/or high breadth or diversification"
- "Every active manager, no matter their investment style, must articulate some winning combination of skill, breadth, and efficiency. Quantitative strategies tend to focus on all three of these. Fundamental strategies aim in particular for high *IC*—deep understanding of the relatively few stocks they hold—in combination with lower breadth and efficiency."

	- "Much of the job of an active manager is to forecast residual returns. Active managers can also forecast market returns, and some do. (...) however, it's difficult to deliver consistent performance by implementing such forecasts (timing the market)"
