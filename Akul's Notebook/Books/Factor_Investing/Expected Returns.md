## <u>Foreward (Cliff Asness)</u>
- "three useful perspective to examine the source of expected returns"
	1. Asset classes: getting paid for owning an asset class
	2. Systematic strategies: momentum, value, carry-based investing, etc.
	3. Risk factors: economic growth, liquidity, inflation, etc.
- Useful methods for estimated expected returns: (weakest to strongest)
	1. "forecast the future from looking purely at how something has done in the past"
	2. "based solely on your theory of how the world should work without examining the data"
	3. "jump straight to current measures (e.g., the P/E of the stock market, the nominal or real yield on bonds) and use them to forecast"
# Part I: Overview, Historical returns, and Academic theories
## <u>Chapter 1: Introduction</u>
- "A central insight from academic finance theories is that required asset returns have little to do with an asset's standalone volatility and more to do with when losses can be expected to occur"
	- "high-risk premia for assets that fare poorly in bad times"
	- "strategies that resemble selling financial catastrophe insurance - steady small gains punctuated by infrequent but large losses - warrant especially high risk premia because their losses are so highly concentrated in the worst times"
- "expected returns for any investment tend to be especially high following adverse events". For example, equity markets after recessions, and nominal bonds after high inflations"
- Factors to take into account when making "judgements about the expected returns of various investments":
	- Historical average returns;
	- Financial and behavioural theories;
	- Forward-looking market indicators such as bond yields; and
	- Discretionary views

- ### Historical performance
	- "Unexpected news dominates returns in the short run but the effects of such news tend to cancel out in the long run"
	- "longer historical windows reduce sample specificity and enable more accurate estimates of average returns. However, distant historical data may be irrelevant due to structural changes, apart from lower data quality"
	- "Stock markets have outperformed fixed income markets during the past century in all countries studied. \[…] The experience of the current investor generation has buried the myth that stocks always beat bonds over 20-year or 30-year horizons"
	- "long-term bonds have outperformed short-dated bonds by 0.5% to 1% and credit-risky corporate bonds have outperformed comparable government bonds by 0.3% to 1%"
		- "more surprisingly, the reward for bearing interest rate risk or credit risk is more consistent at short maturities"
	- "Illiquid assets have tended to offer moderately higher long-run returns than their liquid peers"
	- Active strategy styles have proved profitable in several asset classes:
		- <u>Value</u>: overweighting assets that appear cheaper based on some valuation metrics, while underweighting richly valued peers
		- <u>Carry</u>: high-yielding assets vs. low-yielding assets
		- <u>Momentum</u>: outperforming assets vs. laggard assets
		- <u>Growth</u> assets underperform because investors probably end up overpaying for growth assets. "No investment is attractive at any price, however fast growing it has been"
		- "Yield seeking has been profitable in many contexts but more so in cross-country trades \[…]. The worst results are for complex carry products that may contain hidden costs and risks"
		- "Chasing returns sounds very naïve but favouring past winners has not been a bad strategy historically"
		- "Volatility and long-term average returns are positively related across asset classes"
			- "However, the most volatile assets within each asset class (high volatility stocks, 30-year Treasuries, and CCC-rated corporates) tend to offer low long-run returns and even worse risk-adjusted returns"
			- "Avoiding inherently volatile pockets of each market (lottery tickets) and leveraging up inherently stable assets have boosted returns in the past

- ### Financial and Behavioural Theories: A Brief History of Ideas
	- "Until the 1950s finance theory hardly existed: the focus was on predicting cash flows, not on risk or required returns"
		- "each asset's market price equals the expected sum of its future cash flows discounted to the present value"
		- "Asset-pricing theory focuses on the determinants of discount rates or required returns"
		- Capital Asset Pricing Model: "an asset's amount of risk is fully captured by its (equity) market beta, while general investor risk aversion determines the size of the market risk premium"
		- "The difference in expected returns across assets reflects only differences in the betas of the assets"
	- "In recent decades, high-beta stocks and high-volatility stocks gave no return advantage, perhaps the reverse. Value and momentum tilts were more consistent return enhancers among equities, while related carry and trend strategies fared well in other asset markets"
	- "Several very large boom-bust cycles made the idea of constant risk premia less credible and that of market timing more acceptable"
	- Complex reality with multiple return drivers, both rational and irrational
		- "the most reliable way \[of earning expected returns higher than risk-less rate] is to bear risks that markets reward with a premium"
		- "Beyond equity market beta, exposures to inflation, illiquidity, and tail risks (such as volatility) influence many assets and are rewarded"
		- "Portfolio diversification is more effective with independent or, even better, with negatively correlated return sources"
	- Expected return differentials across assets depend less on volatility and more on the typical timing of losses
		- Stocks deserving higher long-run returns than bonds because stocks are more volatile or long bonds deserving higher returns than short bonds for the same reason, "points in the right direction - that risk influences expected returns - but misses the fact that <u>all volatility is not equal</u>"
		- **"Diversifiable (idiosyncratic) risks should not earn any reward; only systematic risks can be expected to be rewarded with a premium"**
		- Key rational theme that explains what drives financial risk premia: "*Assets or factors that perform poorly in 'bad times' - recessions and financial crises - warrant high required returns*"
		- "Investors should be especially wary of strategies that amount to selling tail insurance or 'lottery tickets' that pay off in bad times - writing options on equity indices, carry trading, and harvesting illiquidity premia"
			- They "combine the dangers of (i) asymmetric returns and (ii) the coincidence of large losses with bad times"
	- Expected rewards on all return sources can vary over time
		- Market timing was generally avoided, because: "timing was not easy; the directional bet is highly concentrated; and cash holdings miss out the equity premium"
		- "The boom-bust cycles of the past decade shifted the consensus to embrace the idea that expected returns vary over time. Market timing no longer had such a bad name. Investors began to pay attention to forward-looking valuation ratios"

- ### Forward-Looking Indicators
	- - "Forward-looking indicators such as earnings yields and bond yields are often better than historical average returns at forecasting long-term returns"
	- **"It is not just the equity risk premium that varies predictably over time - most premia do"**
	- "Such time variation is most obvious in the fluctuations of credit spreads"
		- Inflation risk premium in nominal bonds was clearly higher in the 1980s than in the 2000s because of the recent inflationary regime of the 1970s. Illiquidity premium in many assets shifted from negligible in 2006-07 to record high levels in 2008-09.
		- "When salient adverse events for any risk factor materialise, the *ex-ante* premium tends to widen and then only gradually decay from elevated levels, with the pace of the decay perhaps related to lingering investor memories"
	- "Many stock-market-timers use the dividend discount models to assess prospective equity returns. \[…] Many investors can hardly believe that long-run real growth rates for earning per share and dividends per share are between 0% and 2%, clearly lagging the trend growth rate for real GDP"
	- "Yield curve steepness is often used a proxy for the reward for bearing interest rate risk"
		- "survey-based bond risk premia have given a better picture of the market's required reward for interest rate risk than has curve steepness; survey-based premia have trend up and down together with the inflation level"
	- "credit spread of investment-grade corporates over Treasuries has averaged over 100 basis points in recent decades yet index investors in corporate credits earned only about a quarter of this spread as realised excess return. \[…] The worst leakage was due to index investors' tendency to sell assets that leave the index and that tend to subsequently perform well"
