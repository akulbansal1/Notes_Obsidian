- "there is some physical world limitation that is causing your values to get truncated at that point "
- for example: student GPAs.

- "there some kind of barrier to entry for a data point to get those really high (low) values"
- "we have to think about what is the barrier to entry; what is that a data point needs to be so special that it becomes a part of the tail"

- "generally means you're mixing two groups into a single dataset"
- "is there a reason there could be multiple groups in my population"

- "the 'point' is a very very very likely place for points in the distribution to end up and it's very unlikely for the point in the distribution to take even slightly nearby values to that centre"

## Noisy

- "the sample size this distribution is based off of is extremely low relative to the number of bins you've chosen to use"
