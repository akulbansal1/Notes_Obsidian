## <u>Abstract</u>
- How to hedge equity portfolios
- Continuously holding short-dates S&P puts "is the most reliable defensive method but also the most costly strategy"
- Holding safe-haven assets produce positive carry but may be unreliable crisis-hedge.
- Dynamic strategies that perform well:
	- Futures time-series momentum; benefits from extended equity sell-off
	- "a quality strategy that takes long/short positions in the highest/lowest quality company stock"; benefits from 'flight to quality' effect during crises

- "Typical investment portfolio is highly concentrated in equities"
- "We examine the performance of a number of candidate defensive strategies, both active and passive, between 1985 and 2018"
- ###### Passive strategies![[Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 10.54.23 AM.png]]
	1. **Buy, and then roll, one-month S&P 500 put options**
		- "seems too expensive to be a viable crisis hedge"
		- "once a drawdown has begun, the subsequent rolls of the options become more expensive as implied volatility rises, increasing the cost of the hedge. This effect then requires accelerated price decreases to produce the same hedge return"
	2. **Long credit protection (short credit risk)**
		- "is less costly during normal times and non-recessions than the put buying strategy"
		- Our passive investment uses the negative of: returns obtained by holding investment grade corporate bonds in "excess of duration-matched Treasury bonds"
		- "we scaled the returns ex-post to achieve a volatility of 10% across the whole sample"
		- "Similar to the put strategy, the credit strategy appears to have had negative returns on average outside of equity market drawdowns periods"
- ###### 'Save-haven' investments -
	3. **Long 10-year US Treasuries**
		- Bond-equity correlation has been negative post-2000, "which is atypical from the longer historical perspective"
		- The negative correlation may revert to the previous norm "as we move beyond the extreme monetary easing that has characterized the post-Financial Crisis period"
		- "it is only during the drawdowns after 2000 that bonds performed well. During the earlier drawdowns, the performance of bonds was mixed"
		- "Although post-2000 the correlation was negative, it was positive for most of the 100 years before that. This is in line with [studies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1687547) that argue common fundamental factors would typically imply a positive bond-equity correlation"![[Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 10.55.34 AM.png]]
	4. **Long gold**
		- "generally performs better during crisis periods than at normal times"
		- "its long-run return, measured over the 1985-2018 period, is close to zero"
		- "extended historical evidence presented in [Erb and Harvey (2013)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2202645) suggests that gold is an unreliable equity and business cycle hedge"
		- "While gold has kept its buying power over millennia (real return is zero), the large amount of idiosyncratic noise means that holding periods need to be measured not in years -- but in centuries"
- ###### Dynamic strategies
	- (shorting currency carry or taking long positions in on-the-run Treasury against short in off-the-run bonds are expensive in the long-term); "we choose to focus only on those that are, at least, positive in expectation before costs"
	5. **Time series momentum**: "applied to 50 futures and forward markets"; "we explore both an unconstrained strategy and one where equity exposures are capped at zero (no long equity positions)
		- Add to winning positions and reduce losing positions
		- "also explore limiting equity exposure" during downtrends
		- "medium-term time-series [3 months lookback window] momentum strategies have performed well during recent crisis period (including 2018Q4), as well as over our full sample"![[Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 10.57.07 AM.png]]
	6. **Long-short quality strategy**
		- "take long positions in high-quality and short positions in low-quality companies are most promising as crisis hedges"
		- Being beta-neutral is more important than dollar-neutral
		- [Research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11142-018-9470-2) shows that "while quality stocks logically deserve a higher price-to-book ratio, in reality they do not always exhibit such a premium. In particular towards the end of equity bull markets, quality stocks have often looked underpriced"
		- Formula for price-to-book ratio is given on the right. Price = dividend / (required return - growth); Profitability = profit/B; and Payout ratio = dividend/profit![[Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 10.58.11 AM.png]]
			- Profitability: profits (gross profits, earnings, cash flows) scaled by an accounting value (book equity, book assets, sales);
			- Growth: trailing five-year growth of a profitability measure;
			- Safety (required return): safer companies command lower required returns; return-based measures include market beta and volatility and fundamental-based measures include low leverage, low volatility of profitability and low credit risk
			- Payout: fraction of profits paid out to shareholders; 'shareholder friendliness' of management

- "Only for financial crisis do the recession and stock market drawdown periods mostly overlap"
- "investors face a trade-off between reliability and cost of the hedge"
- Table 10 shows the performance of a portfolio that includes varying allocation to dynamic hedging strategies.![[Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 10.58.56 AM.png]]
