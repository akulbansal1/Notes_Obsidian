## <u>Abstract</u>
- "Rebalancing is similar to starting with a buy and hold portfolio and adding a short straddle [...] on the relative value of the portfolio assets"

## <u>Introduction</u>
- "*rebalancing can magnify drawdowns* when there are pronounced divergences in asset performance".
- "the opposing return profile of a momentum overlay can help to mitigate the added risk introduced by the rebalancing process"

## <u>Fixed Weights vs Drift Weights</u>
- "We shall also call the buy-and-hold approach a *drift-weight* portfolio, to be contrasted with *fixed weights* under rebalancing"
- "The performance difference between fixed weights and drift weights shows the characteristic return profile (sometimes called 'negative convexity') of an investor who has sold both put and call options (on the relative performance of stocks and bonds)"
- "Figure 3 shows the difference in one-year returns between fixed-weight rebalancing and drift weights using both empirical (Panel A) and simulated (Panel B) data"
	- "The simulation takes two asset returns using lognormal distributions with volatilities of 20% and 6% and a constant -20% correlation"![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.51.48 PM.png]]

## <u>Why Does Fixed-Weight Rebalancing Have Higher Drawdowns?</u>
- "A trend-less environment, especially one characterised by mean reversion, would clearly be friendly to this strategyâ€”losers would bounce back, high-flyers would come down to earth and rebalancing investors would gain from their trades"

## <u>Momentum Has the Opposite Characteristics to Fixed-Weight Rebalancing</u>
- "In Figure 5, we apply momentum to stocks and bonds individually, and graph the performance as a function of the divergence between stocks and bonds. Panel A uses overlapping one-year returns to the S&P500 and the 10-year US Treasury bonds, while Panel B uses simulated data as in Figure 3".![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.55.33 PM.png]]

## <u>Momentum to the Rescue?</u>
- "adding a momentum overlay to a constant-mix portfolio improves the risk properties of the portfolio".
- "Figure 6 illustrates the cumulative return of assets with fixed-weight rebalancing combined with a 10% momentum overlay, as a function of asset divergence".
	- "The momentum overlay uses a moving average cross-over model employed at AHL"![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.55.58 PM.png]]
- "a momentum overlay allows one to maintain a sensible rebalancing schedule without increased drawdown risk"

## <u>Conclusion</u>
- "rebalancing represents a kind of anti-momentum trading in which one buys underperforming assets and sells outperforming assets".
- "even without any assumptions of positive performance [of just the momentum overlay], our analysis shows that momentum acts to improve the risk and drawdown properties of the constant-mix portfolio".
