-   "A VIXPlosion is an event/catalyst that causes weighted strip IVOL to accelerate the upside like it's no tomorrow.
-   Why does this happen? Either it's due to players getting involved in overcrowded levered beta while thinking it's alpha. […]
	- Example: Before February 2018, there used to be an infinite money glitch, that ALWAYS made money. What could go wrong many players whispered, vol spread reverts more to the downside than the upside. So like a bunch of greedy dogs they piled in. […]
- Now this brings me to my second point of why VIXplosions happen. The repricing of risk, which is caused by several different factors such as major catalysts trying to be priced in, and two-sided flow in a strongly one-sided flow product, etc.
	- Example: Corona Crash, risk got repriced like the end of the world was tomorrow and tail sellers got crushed.
- Major VIXplosions are often a combination of risk getting repriced due to a major catalyst + players piling into overcrowded beta and getting crushed.
- [...] We can talk about how to take advantage of them [VIXPlosion].
-   Most popular method: systematically allocating a portion of your book to VIX call tails monthly and expecting to lose the premium paid most of the time and waiting for that BIG payout to happen.
- Another variation that I like better is timing your allocations based on the vol regime (tactical tail buying). This way the odds are more skewed for the big payout to happen relative to just buying tails each month.
	- Or you could do the most popular method while reducing the cost of carrying (decay) by finding products with wide +VRP and selling vol risk defined and using the proceed to finance call VIX tails. However you add more risk, but lower the prob of losing.
	- Or the sigma giga alpha chad method, where you harvest alpha to fund two types of allocations (systematic tail buying and tactical tail buying). I personally incorporate this method, as it has the highest return/efficiency.
