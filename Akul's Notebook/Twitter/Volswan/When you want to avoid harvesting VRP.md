- "If you can avoid environments with major vol shocks and vol shifts, you will have removed the majority of the major drawdowns associated with VRP harvesting. Model regimes where major vol shocks & vol shifts occur and where they don't normally occur.
- Vol shocks are usually associated with large moves to the downside in the indices. Vol shifts take place after vol shocks have occurred, which leads to brutal rallies where vol gets crushed but the market moves more than implied".
