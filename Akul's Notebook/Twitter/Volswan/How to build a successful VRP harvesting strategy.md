#idea_vol_trading 

- "First you MUST identify vol regimes. Which ones pay the most/least relative to the risk you inventory.
- Find a way to forecast realized volatility (HARQ/An average of all GARCH vol models).
- Create a position sizing / portfolio management plan (use half/quarter, Kelly criterion, depending on the variance you are fine withholding). How much BP (Buying Power) are you fine with allocating to VRP strategies at one time?.
- Now select the tenors (usually 30 dte) and price out ATM straddle or 25d strangle via your vol forecast so you can arrive at a theoretical price.
- Depending on the skew shape, flat or steep. If flat, trade an iron fly structure (short ATM, long wings 25d). If steep, trade an iron condor structure (short 30-25d, long wings 29d-24d) the wings should be always centered on the implied range.
- Now use the theoretical price relative to spot price (straddle/strangle) as a profit target for your Iron fly/IC (Iron Condor).
- If the theoretical edge is big enough relative to your risk, then it might be a good trade. If the edge is too small, forget the trade you have plenty of other opportunities.
- Lastly do not expect to win on each trade, and manage your risk appropriately via long tactical long vol positions so you can benefit from vol increasing.
- Do not size too big on a portfolio level, like don't have 50% of your BP in VRP harvesting structures".
