	- "our analysis is the investor's willingness to re-enter the market given that he reconsiders his absence from the market at a specific point in time. In order to determine this, we need to compare the investor's utility from remaining outside the market and re-entering. […] markets often experience temporary reversals of the downward trend, also known as dead cat bounce or bear market rally. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to offer an explanation for a phenomenon which is largely recognized in financial markets"

- "In bear markets, we must turn our thinking upside down in many respects. For example, a 'reaction' is now an up-move, because it is against the main trend. Every leg-down in a bear market is interrupted by a secondary reaction, which may come in two or three phases. These reactions are lifesavers for those who failed to take action when the bull market ended and are now stuck with giant losses. The secondary reaction gives us a chance to 'bail out' at higher prices. It also gives an opportunity for shorting"
