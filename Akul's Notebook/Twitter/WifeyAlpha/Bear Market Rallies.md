- So what could cause a bear market rally in this environment? Short-term correlation flips?
- Stock-bond correlation changes seem to be driven by financial crises and the variability in inflation.
- Prior to 1997, negative shocks to growth were often accompanies by positive shocks to inflation, so government bonds and stocks both sold off in tandem.
- Subsequent to 1996, government bonds were negatively correlated with stocks, especially during equity market sell-offs. This is likely because inflation was perceived as being largely under control"
- "Although a short-term negative correlation might be caused by higher market volatility, a longer-term negative correlation might signify a general change in economic conditions"![[Pasted image 20230424183741.png]]![[Pasted image 20230424183752.png]]
- "Fear, inflation, and growth can all affect correlation. To help distil this all into a tractable and testable model, we focus on the role of real rates, inflation expectations, and sentiment in explaining the correlation between stock and bonds returns"![[Pasted image 20230424183902.png]]![[Pasted image 20230424183931.png]]


[Thread](https://twitter.com/WifeyAlpha/status/1539966248787886080) on Bear Market Rallies
1. What are Bear Market Rallies?
	- "short covering rallies and at times when aggressive downwards moves become exhausted"
	- "BMR are market bids over +5%"
2. Expected BMR length and peak
	- 2008 GFC top BMRs 24%, 19%, 12%, 12%, & 11%
	- Dot Com top BMRs 21%, 21%, 19%, & 15%
	- "not bear inflationary markets but they have the most similar structure"
	- "Can last quarters & seem like regime change"
3. How to trade BMR start & end
	- "Start: Technicals can overpower fundamentals in the short-term & cause brutal rallies. Exhaustion and overextension are prerequisites"
	- End: "it is invariably easier to call the end of a bear market rally than the beginning. [...] In such action the peak is frequently attained on a sudden increase in activity lasting a few days. [...] Dullness following the peak of a bear market rally is a common danger sign"
4. How to prepare for BMR

Short [thread](https://twitter.com/WifeyAlpha/status/1556966271018827781) on late stage bear market rallies
- In the later stages of bear market rallies there are numerous signals both quantitative and qualitative. We will start for the form and end with the latter.
- Quantitative: You are looking for market momentum exhaustion and high probability zones of reversal. The combination of multi timeframes can helpÂ  capture the market turning points along with fading volume and market 'dullness'
- When they say 'never short a dull market' this is in bull market regimes. Well, the same applies to in bear markets, 'never long a dull market'.  
	- Volatility regime modelling and corresponding vol moves can help shape equity delta bear market rallies.
- Qualitative: You are looking for market participants starting to call a 'new bull market'. They do this to disguise themselves as informed market participants but really they are just the market portfolio and beta normie.
- You are seeing people starting to get emotional over the (small) possibility they could recover all losses from the bear market. The reason the market bids in bear market rally is due to the market temporarily ending a 'fundamental sell off' as technicians have become so stretched that they have taken over thus creating a technical rally. This is not a fundamental bid and thus needs to be acknowledged. The perma-bulls will try to convince you otherwise.
