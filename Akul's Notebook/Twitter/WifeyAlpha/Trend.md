- Long-term momentum = 9-12 months; short-term momentum = 1-3 months
	- These two will "often produce very different results during periods of market stress, like we saw [in 2020] with the Covid pullback. Whipsaw massacre"
- "short-term trend preference could be a temporary state driven by an activist Fed. As the effectiveness of Fed intervention wanes, markets could return to a healthier state where long-term momentum prevails"
	- "Healthier state could be a long-term downward trend in risk prices"
