		Couldn't access the paper but from reading the Abstract, I guess the paper talks about the benefits of adding short-term momentum to the portfolio. Convexity of trend-following returns increases as the lookback period (of calculating momentum/trend) is reduced. Man AHL wrote a blog on this effect too, [here](https://www.man.com/maninstitute/need-for-speed-trend-following).
