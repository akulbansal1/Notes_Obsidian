- "How high will inflation get, and how long will it last?"
	- "With COVID, before the Russia-Ukraine war, inflation would last at least a year or two, and could reach high single-digit or low pre-pandemic level.
	- Supply chains always take longer to recover than predicted. With the addition of this way, that recovery, initially from COVID disruptions, could yet be longer. But even if his becomes a protracted war or quagmire, along the lines of Bosnia, Kosova, Afghanistan, or Iraq the world eventually adjusts.
	- They key is that inflation has always ended fairly quickly once its root cause is resolved. A war ends, factories and workers return, and inflation ends. A pandemic ends, as happened in 1920, and inflation ends. Oil prices drop in the early 1980s, and inflation ends.
	- Some disagree. For these analysts, inflation is a structural monetary issue that stems from money supply growth. This view, which took root in the 1970s and 1980s, has been discredited by 40 years of experience and data. Japan's inflation has been close to zero for twenty-five years, and yet its government and monetary growth dwarf economies.
	- After the 2008 crisis, the US government stimulus and support brough extraordinary money supply growth without bringing inflation.
	- We have pledged not to commit out military and risk world war. Meanwhile, we are accelerating our financial support for Ukraine, and are imposing vigorous economic sanctions that promise to put upwards pressure on oil. gas, adn other commodities".
