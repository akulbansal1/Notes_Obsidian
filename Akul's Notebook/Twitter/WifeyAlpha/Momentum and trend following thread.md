- "Trend following sounds a lot like the Momentum equity style factor. In fact, the two have a positive long-term correlation of 0.3. How are these two factors different, and why does it matter?
- Difference #1: The Underlying Asset Class
	- The first, most obvious difference between the two is the asset classes used to construct each factor. Momentum is an equity style factor that is built using individual stocks—so it could be long Apple and short Alphabet.
	- Trend Following is a macro style factor and is therefore built using derivatives (like futures and forwards) or ETFs in several macro asset classes: equities, fixed income, currencies, and crypto, commodities—so it could be long an ES contract and short a gold futures.
- Difference #2: Cross-Sectional vs. Time Series Momentum"
	- "arguably the most important […] the type of momentum that they are capturing".
	- "The Momentum equity style factor is constructed cross-sectionally, […]. Trend Following, on the other hand, is constructed using time series momentum".
	- "This has an important implication: the Momentum factor will be market neutral to global equity markets at all times, while the Trend Following factor can take on conditional (positive or negative) correlation in any of the five asset classes".
- Difference #3: The Lookback Period
	- [...] The Momentum equity style factor considers the stock's performance over the past 1, 3, 6, and 12 months,
	- whereas the Trend Following macro style factor considers the contract's performance over the past 1 and 3 months and over the past 6 and 12 months (the two lookback periods are equally-weighted). The reason for the shorter-term component to Trend Following is that in practice, macro trend followers and Commodity Trading Advisors (or CTAs) tend to focus on shorter horizons due to the abundant liquidity and capacity of the underlying macro derivatives that they trade".

Conclusion
- "we believe it's important to include both factors in a risk model, as they will tend to show up for different reasons.
- The Momentum equity style factor can appear in equity market neutral, long-short equity, or even long-only stock funds, especially when the latter is compared relative to its benchmark.
- Trend Following macro style factor can appear in trend followers, global macro managers, or CTAs. If you have a mix of these types of strategies in your portfolio you will benefit from diversification and it will be important for allocators evaluating multi-strategy PMs".
