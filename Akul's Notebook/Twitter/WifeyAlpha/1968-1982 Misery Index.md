Studying 1968 to 1982 using the Misery Index (inflation and employment rate)
- "Americans who lived through the Great Inflation do not remember it fondly at least from an economic perspective.
- From 1968 to 1982, the U.S. experienced four recessions (1969-1970, 1973-1975, 1980, and 1981-1982). Meanwhile, increasingly high rates of inflation led to significant losses in real wages, leaving workers with higher paychecks but less purchasing power.
- Home loans and commercial loans became increasingly unaffordable, as lenders were forced to increase interest rates to provide adequate compensation for higher inflation expectations.
- Stock returns were abysmal, as investors demanded higher rates return relative to rising interest rates, causing price/earnings ratios to plummet.
- Finally, the distraction of price instability stunted business investment and operation efficiency, leading to sharp declines in productivity. The feeling of hopelessness during the Great Inflation was reminiscent of the Great Depression. In fact, the similarity is evident in a metric known as the Misery Index, which adds the inflation rate and the unemployment rate. As the chart below reveals (1929-2021), the misery index during the Great Inflation was not much lower than it was during the 1930s. Specifically, the average Misery Index from 1968-1982 was 13.6% versus 16.3% during the 1930s".
