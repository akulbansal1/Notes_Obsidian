Types of Asset Allocation:

1. Strategic
	- "established and adheres to a 'base policy mix' - a proportional combination of assets based on expected rates of return for each asset class"
	- "if stocks have historically returned 10% per year and bonds have returned 5% per year, a mix of 50% stocks and 50% bonds would be expected to return 7.5% per year".
2. Passive
	- "Strategic asset allocation generally implies a buy-and-hold strategy, even as shift in values of assets causes a drift from the initially established policy mix".
	- "you may choose to adopt a constant-weighting approach to asset allocation. [â€¦] you continually rebalance your portfolio".
	- "There are no hard-and-fast rules for timing portfolio rebalancing under strategic or constant-weighting asset allocation. Rule of thumb is that the portfolio should be rebalanced to its original mix when any given asset class moves more than 5% from its value".
3. Tactical
	- "you may find it necessary to occasionally engage in short-term, tactical deviations from the mix to capitalize unusual or exceptional investment opportunities".
	- "This flexibility adds a market timing component to the portfolio, allowing you to participate in economic conditions more favorable for one asset class than for others".
	- "Tactical asset allocation can be described as a moderately active strategy, since the overall strategic asset mix is returned to when desired short-term profits are achieved".
	- "This strategy demands some discipline, as you must first be able to recognize when short-term opportunities have run their course, and then rebalance the portfolio to the long-term asset portfolio".
4. Dynamic
	- "you constantly adjust the mix of assets as markets rise and fall, and as the economy strengthens and weakens".
	- "With this strategy you sell assets that are declining and purchase assets that are increasing, making dynamic asset allocation the polar opposite of a constant-weighting strategy".
5. Insured
	- "you establish a base portfolio value under which the portfolio should not be allowed to drop. As long as the portfolio achieves a return above its base, you exercise active management to try to increase the portfolio value as much as possible".
	- "If, however, the portfolio should ever drop to the base value, you invest in risk-free assets so that the base value becomes fixed. At such time, you would consult with your advisor on re-allocating assets, perhaps even changing your investment strategy entirely"
	- "may be suitable for risk-averse investors who desire a certain level of active portfolio management but appreciate the security of establishing a guaranteed floor below which the portfolio is not allowed to decline".
6. Macro
	- "With integrated asset allocation, you consider both your economic expectations and your risk in establishing an asset mix".
	- "While all of the above-mentioned strategies take into account expectations for future market returns, not all of the strategies account for investment risk tolerance".
	- "Integrated asset allocation, on the other hand, includes aspects of all strategies, accounting not only for expectations but also actual changes in capital markets and your risk tolerance".
	- "Integrated asset allocation is a broader asset allocation strategy, albeit allowing only either dynamic or passive allocation. Obviously, an investor would not wish to implement two strategies that have similar distribution of returns with one another".
