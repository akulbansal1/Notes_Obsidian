- "In economic terms, the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is often compared to a war, national resources have been commanded in a battle against an 'invisible enemy', driving government debt levels sharply higher around the world. (GS)![[Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 3.36.43 PM.png]]
- To see how far this analogy can be extended, we use data extending back to the Black Death in the 1300s to compare how inflation and government bond yields have behaved in the aftermath of the world's 12 largest wars and pandemics.![[Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 3.37.17 PM.png]]
- We find inflation has typically risen sharply during and (especially) in the aftermath of major wars, it has generally remained weak during and after major pandemics. Moreover, while bond yields have typically risen during wars, they have remained relatively stable during pandemics and fallen in their aftermath.![[Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 9.18.30 PM.png]]
- Our view, this contrast in the performance of inflation and bond yields during wars and pandemics makes intuitive sense, for two reason:![[Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 9.19.00 PM.png]]
	- First, in wars, government spending is used to fund increased war-related expenditure (before and during wars) and reconstruction efforts (in the aftermath), placing significant strain on available resources. In pandemics, by contrast, any increase in government spending is used to fill the gap left by absent private sector demand, with very different implications for the overall balance between aggregate demand and supply.
	- Second, wars are often associated with the widespread destruction of physical capital, a development that increases the demand for investment and pushes interest rates higher. While pandemic result in a widespread loss of life, they do not result in any loss of physical capital. If there is widespread loss of life, can result in an increase in the capital-labor ratio. Standard economic theory suggests that a higher capital-labor ratio should lower equilibrium interest rates, while raising real wages.![[Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 9.19.38 PM.png]]
- Every war and pandemic is different, and we should be cautious of drawing lessons from events that occurred in the long-distant past and in very different circumstances. One feature of the current pandemic that is clearly distinctive to past episodes is the size of the government response. Equally, however, one can argue that an unusually large government response was necessitated by an unusually large collapse in private sector demand".
