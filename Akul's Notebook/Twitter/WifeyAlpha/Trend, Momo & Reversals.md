- [ ] Trend and Cycles of Style Factors in the 20th and 21st Centuries (Blackrock) (2022) ([link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4279022))
	- "To get a sense if the regimes have changed their frequency across the 20th and 21st centuries, I compute the realized regime durations in each sample.
	- A given time period is classified as regime 1 is the smoothed probability *P r(st = 1 \ IT) > 0.5* and regime 2 is *P r(st =2 \ IT) > 0.5*, with *P r(st =1 \ IT) > 0.5 + P r(st = 2 \ IT) > 0.5 = 1*.
	- *s* --> the realised duration in each regime in years. The market duration of the bear market regime is the same, at 1.0 years, pre-2000 and post-2001, as is the momentum bear market regime duration at 0.5 years.
	- Size, value, and low volatility factors, in contrast, experience increases in the durations of their bear market regimes: the duration of the low-mean regime for size increases from 3.1 to 5.6 years, value bear markets increase almost one year, from 4.7 to 5.7 years, and low volatility bear markets increase from 0.5 to 1.1 years, moving from the pre-2000 to post-2001 period, respectivaly. These increases in regime duration are consistent with the lower levels of HP trends in the 21st century".
