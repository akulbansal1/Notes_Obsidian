## Research:
- [ ] [[Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading]]
	- "try not to go too deep into the machine learning path. The way they thing about features as alphas in Chapter 4 is a really good framework "
- [ ] [[Finding Alpha]]
	- "continues the mental framework used in ML4T"
- [ ] [[Quantitative Portfolio Management]]
	- "Portfolio optimisation chapter is brilliant"
- [ ] [[Optimal Trading Strategies]]
	- "A bit of help on the execution side, but generally avoid mathematical models and focus on papers that are empirically focused"
- [ ] [[The Elements of Statistical Learning]]
	- "the bible of statistics. Read it 3x"
	- [ ] Easier version : [[An Introduction to Statistical Learning]]
- [ ] [[Advanced Futures Trading Strategies]]
	- "will help your understanding of modern strategies"
- [ ] [[Advanced Algorithmic Trading]]
	- "I think all of the backtests shown are overfit to make them look better, but it is a good idea to get familiar with approaches/ideas to improve your own creative process"
- [ ] [[Analysis of Financial Time Series]]
	- "Some good methods, but I wouldn't get too attached to those ideas as a gold standard"
- [ ] [[Bayesian Data Analysis]]
- [ ] [[Digital Signal Processing]]
	- "really to get exposure from other areas of statistical modelling"
- [ ] [[Advances In Financial Machine Learning]]
	- "Avoid the bs quantum computing, but all round should be on everyone's bookshelf"
- [ ] [[Data-Driven Science and Engineering]]
	- "I find a lot of value in these methods/understanding how other fields approach these problems"
- [ ] [[Regression Analysis with Python]]
	- "Having a deep intuition of what your linear regression is telling you is important. Read this and also apply it with kaggle / a wide variety of datasets"
- [ ] [[Regression Modeling Strategies]]
	- "gives a lot of intuition / deep understanding of linear regressions"
- [ ] [[Convex Optimization]]
	- "should be in everyone's toolbox"
	- [ ] [[Handbook on Semidefinite, Conic and Polynomial Optimization]] goes a bit deeper
