- "This should give you the basic knowledge of the topics you come across the most in quant.
	- From here you can specialise even more. You mostly do this by reading, implementing and improving research papers and then working on coming up with your own ideas"
- "An example from statistical arbitrage:
	- Implement the SMRP paper in crypto, figure out what works and what doesn't and try to improve it.
	- How many assets do you want? Is the portfolio mean reverting enough? Is it volatile enough? etc."
