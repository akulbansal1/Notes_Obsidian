## Akul:
Hello,
I have been following your work for quite a while and I gotta appreciate all you're doing. You've helped me A LOT by putting all the research pieces out so thank you so much for that. 
I've been wanting to ask you a few things but I hesitated until now because I thought to myself "He's already done a lot for me" but I built up the courage to shoot my question anyways. So here it goes.
My background, in brief:
Graduated from high school in 2018.
Skipped college and started working with a trader (who had been trading semi-systematically since 2016) and managing a small pool of capital.
All along, I kept consuming as many books and podcasts and blogs I could find. 
December 2020: Stumbled upon a hedge fund here in India who was just building out their Quant department. And kept networking with the head of Quant at that hedge fund.
July 2021: joined the Quant department as a researcher/trader. 
All this while, I continued consuming knowledge (in the Quant space) as much as possible until I hit somewhat of a roadblock in mid 2022. My high school level math and no coding experience was making it ever more difficult for me to do what I have always eventually wanted to do: QUANT MACRO.
Jan 2023: I started coding seriously and I started Data Science and Programming online degree program to improve my modelling skills and Programming.

I'm sorry for sending you so many texts. I will understand if you don't have the time to read all of it. If so, PLEASE JUST READ THIS LAST TEXT.
As of now, I have a few price-based trading models in Indian equities but I want to expand my trading to other asset classes as well, incorporating macro fundamentals but I always get so overwhelmed by how many pieces there are and how all the pieces impact each other. You said that you have built out models for almost everything I could think of. What kind of models are they? And how much time did it take you? What skills do I need to be able to do the same? And most importantly, other than WifeyAlpha archive and Nick Givannovic's past videos archive, where do I need to look?
