expanding on the previous article [[Research Drop + Framework]]

- Fundamentals connecting to economic data
	- For example: "if we are looking at auto stocks, you want to connect it to the auto economic data"![[Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 8.06.17 PM.png]]
	- "aggregate assets by their respective sector and sensitivities"
	- "have a comprehensive view of every asset in the market as it connects with a comprehensive view of the economic data"
- Equities
	- Earnings, Valuations and cross-sectional fundamentals
		- "for earnings you want to look at the TTM or most recent earnings, earnings expectations, and if the earnings releases come in above or below expectations"
		- "Valuations are primarily going to be a function of liquidity but there can be other things moving valuations"
		- "is the valuations function or the earnings functions moving this sector/stocks?"![[Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 8.10.13 PM.png]]
		- "different sectors outperform/underperform depending on the macro regime we are in. So you want to look at cross-sectional (just means relative) fundamentals and cross-sectional momentum"
	- Factors connecting to the regime
		- "look at factor exposure and returns in equities". Read [[Strategic Risk Management]] book on this.
	- "Once you have an idea of how all the different sector returns work as economic data is released and how different factor performances work in different regimes, you can then have a much clearer understanding of what the market is pricing in on a macro and even intraday basis"
- Fixed Income
	- Book recommendations:![[Books Recommendations#<u>Fixed Income:</u>]]
	- "short-term interest rate market is one of the most important things you can know when trading markets"
	1. What is happening with duration?
	2. What is happening with credit?
	- "When you correctly establish the skew of growth and inflatoin, you can then correctly analyze when and how much duration risk and credit risk are occuring"
- Commodities
	- "Commodities impact specific components of the CPI complex and can (but don't always) feed into CORE CPI. Inflation doesn't = commodities though"
	- "you want to have some type of broad supply and demand model for each commodity so that you can know where you are in the commodity cycle"
- FX
	- FX Model: BoP, cross-border flows, reserves
	- FX forwards
	- XCCY
	- "need to break down all the various reasons someone might be contrained to buy or sell the currency by breaking down the various drivers of the Balance of Payments"
	- "what is driving the buying and selling of a currency. [...] how that might change in the future and what the implications are"

- "watch the YoY, MoM and 3-month trend of all economic data. Then you want to position yourself in alignment with these as it connects with your time horizon"
	- "What I do is compare the earnings/sales surprises of equities with the economic data surprises. Then I compare this with the earnings/valuations of equities and how the STIR market is changing future expectations for rate hikes/cuts"
- "the best trades are simply identifying points in time where the market is pricing something incredibly unrealistic and fading it"
