expanding on the previous article [[Research Drop + Framework]]

1. Country Pofile/History
	- "want a simple breakdown of the country. You can find decent breakdowns on the [IMF website](https://www.imf.org/en/Home) or [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/)"
	- books on "how the various power/political structures work because they function as mechanisms to transmit capital flows, volatility and risk"
		- [[Why Nations Fail]]
		- [[The Volatility Machine]]
		- classic work on thinking about this: [[Politics]]

2. Demographics
	- [Keynote by Peter Zeihan](https://youtu.be/UA-jOLF2T4c) on Demographics
	- demographics "will connect with the labor market and the labor force participation rate which impacts wages (which impacts inflation)"
	- "the consumption profile of a young person is very different from the consumption profile of an older person"

3. Investment/Ouput Capacity
	- "how much capacity a country has to produce goods, services, and natural resources"
	- "If a demand shock occurs with minimal capacity due to low investment, inflation is likely to occur"

4. Geography
	- [[Prisoners of Geography]]
	- "become really important when things like invasions and wars happen"

5. Natural Resources, Weather, Transportation Networks, Technological Abilities
	- "becoming increasingly important and deglobalization increases its presence"
	- "see how much a country is long or short each commodity through their current account. For example, Japan is predominantly short oil while Canada is long oil"
	- transportation network. "If a country has a ton of goods it needs to export but can't transport them (or vice versa), the impact can ripple across the world"
	- "If a country has very minimal technological abilities, it can really drag on its ability to produce goods and serices even if they have amazing demographics and natural resources"

6. Political Structure/Political Regime/Geopolitics
	- "how much populsim and inequality there is in the country, the bias of spending for the country and what the dominant parties are trying to accomplish"

7. Currency Regime/Monetary Regime/Fiscal Regime
	- breakdown of various currency regimes in [[Innovating The Dollar and Global Financial System]]
	- "you want to identify how decisions surrounding these things [monetary and fiscal policy] occur"
