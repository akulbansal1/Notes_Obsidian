expanding on the previous article [[Research Drop + Framework]]


- "if you understand each of these data topics in a country AND how they connect to each other, you are going to be ahead of 90% of people in macro and financial markets" #idea_macro_trading 
- "what you need to do is build a multidimensional picture of the economy using ALL data points. Furthermore, you need to correctly weigh the significance of these data points in your models"
- A country (like a 10-K) has income statement (Flows) and balance sheet (capital structure). "Growth and inflation reflect the income statement of an economy. Liquidity is what supports the balance sheet capacity of an economy"
- GDP and National Income
	- Nowcasting: "take the monthly data and extrapolate it to the quarterly data"
		- example: monthly PCE and quarterly PCE line item of GDP![[Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 7.06.20 PM.png]]
		- quarterly data is still relevant because "as you have lower frequency data, the quality usually increases"
		- "need to do this with every line item of GDP, National Income and the Integrated Macroeconomic accounts"
- "The rest of the economic data points will be simple to understand if you know how they fit into these quarterly data releases"
- "The capital structure is key because it is the mechanism that transmits the flows of GDP. What you want to do is break down the balance sheet of every agent in the system and then see what asset and liability mismatches exist"
	- "[The Integrated Macroeconomic accounts](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release?rid=52) are the main dataset for this"

- The structure of broad economic data:
	- Flows:
		- GDP
			- Consumption
				- Goods/Services
			- Investment
				- Fixed Investment
			- Inventories
			- Net Exports of goods/services
				- Exports: Goods/services
				- Imports: Goods/services
			- Government Expenditures/Investments
		- National Income
			- Corporate Profits
			- Employee Wages
		- Labor Market/Demographics
			- "every person's consumption is another person's income"
			- "is connected to personal income bby the number of employees, hours worked, and wages"
			- "go see how the line items flow on the personal income and outlay dataset"
		- Service Sector
			- "the primary part of consumption in GDP"
		- Retail/Wholesale Sector
			- "key for the goods sector (again another line item of GDP)"
		- Industrial Sector
			- "really important"
			- "compare industrial production to the current demand, build a picture of the inflationary/disinflationary pressures in the system"
		- Manufacturing/Trade Inventories
			- "depending on the specific dataset you are looking at, monitoring manufacturing and new orderes for durable goods will be important in connecting business demand and current output"
		- Housing and Real Estate
			- "one of the most sensitive components of GDP to interest rates. <b>However, housing IS NOT the business cycle</b>"
			- "aggregate all the datasets on housing and figure out the overall impact it is likely to have on GDP"
		- Personal/Household Sector
			- "get really familiar with personal income and outlays data. This is simply tracking the flows of the household sector"
		- Government
			- "understand how spending adds or drags on GDP"
			- "Government spending does't always = inflation"
			- "Is government spending increasing and offsetting other components of GDP or causing the economy to run hot?"
		- Economic Activity
			- "looking at things like business starts and overall activity measures"
		- Surveys/Cyclical Indicators
			- "The main surveyes you need to watch are the PMIs"
		- Internatonal Trade & BoP
			- "connect this data to the import/export line items of GDP"
			- Read [[Trade Wars are Class Wars]] 
		- Prices
			- "prices across the entire economy"
			- "CPI, PPI, and PCE are the main ones in the United States"
	- Capital Structure:
		- <b>Financial Accounts/Balance Sheets</b>
		- <b>Houshold, Corporates, Financials, Sovereign</b>


Action Plan: #idea_macro_trading 
1. "identify every dataset reflecting these ideas in a country and aggregate a list of them. Then go onto the dataset description and read about the dataset"
2. "start piecing things together and build a picture of the economy. Connect the various frequencies of releases. All the datasets should connec together and build a picture of what is happening"
3. "all economic data is usually free"
4. "Someone who really understands economic data would probably be digusted with how much of a broad brush I am using right now. But my goal is just to get you started"

Tools:
- "To start just use a moving average and rate of change. It will simplify a lot when backtesting any ideas"
