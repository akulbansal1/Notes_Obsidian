Investors, and traders alike, keep a close eye on how different asset classes are behaving. An investor's objective might be to focus only on equities but she will probably also be watching for potential stress signals from commodities, currencies, and especially bonds.

Signals from the bond market are often talked about the most, not just in mainstream media but also in investment committee meetings. Why? Is this because the Bond market is somehow smarter than other asset classes? Or is there some other factor most investors are not aware of?

Let's first understand what do bond yields represent. Bonds are often called 'rates' because bond yields represent the market's expectations of where the interest rates will be in the future. For example, if the market expects interest rate to be 5% 2 years later, the market will price the bond that is maturing in 2 years at the yield of 5%. This expectation of interest rate is a function of two main factors: growth and inflation, and the central bank's response to the changes in growth and inflation. Example, if the market expects growth to pick up and inflation to remain stable, central bank policy to such an environment might be to hike interest rates to slow the economy down (control it from overheating); this will put upward pressure on bond yields (downward pressure on bond prices). Likewise, central bank policy during a recession (negative growth) is to lower interest rates to encourage borrowing.

We often hear yield curve (YC) inversion signalling an upcoming recession. Why? YC inversion is nothing but longer term yield going below shorter term yield, i.e. the bond maturing in 2 years will have a higher yield than the bond maturing in 10 years. Why should this signal an impending recession? Well, if the 10-year is yielding lower than the 2-year, then the bond market is simply expecting the interest rate to be lower 10 years later then its level 2 years later, hence expecting the central bank to lower interest rates in the future; since we know central bank lowers rates when growth is taking a hit, we can conclude an YC inversion as the bond market's expectation of an upcoming growth slowdown, i.e. a recession.

Exhibit a shows the curve of YC spread, i.e. 10-year yield minus 2-year yield. The yield curve steepness peaked in the fourth quarter of 2020, and has been gradually slipping lower over the past 15 months, accelerating the flattening (steepness lowering) after RBI governor Shaktikanta Das last week said on record "expectation of a rate hike is a no-brainer", highlighted by his decision to hike rates in an emergency meeting on 3rd May.![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 7.04.36 PM.png]]

Exhibit b shows the curve of 10-year yield. It has been trending upward continuously since the first quarter of 2021, and stands at approximately 7.4%, up 150 bps from its low made in third quarter of 2020. The 2-year yield has been trending upward in tandem with the 10-year yield (Exhibit c), bottoming in the fourth quarter of 2020. the 2-year yield stands at approximately 6.5%, up 250 bps from its low. Clearly, the 2-year yield has gone higher faster and farther than the 10-year yield.![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 7.04.52 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 7.05.06 PM.png]]

What does this mean for investors and how can we be positioned keeping the recent developments in light? I am going to take a page out of Mcgee's Applied Financial Macroeconomics and Investment Strategy to help answer this question, Exhibit d. With the yields trending up and the YC trending down, we are in a regime known as 'Bear Flattening'. A quick glance at the "Yield-Curve Move" column in Exhibit d takes us to the second and third row. This leaves us with either "Early to Mid-cycle Expansion" phase or "Mid-cycle to Late-Stage Expansion" phase, from the respective "Business Cycle Phase" column in the second and third rows in Exhibit d.![[Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 7.05.26 PM.png]]

In order to approximate which (second or third row) is a better description of the current environment, we look at the second column of Exhibit d, i.e. "Fed-Policy Driving Analogy". Taking into consideration RBI governor's policy response last month and his comments on where the rates are headed in the near future, "Tapping on Brakes" seems a better description of policy response than "Easing Off Accelerator". This would put us in "Mid-Cycles to Late-Stage Expansion", often the phase right before an "Imminent Recession".

Now, you don't need a crystal ball to tell you how you should be positioned in your Fixed Income portfolio; "Underweight to Neutral" (from "Tactical Deviation from Benchmark" column in Exhibit d) seems to be a good position to be in right now, especially with the global bond markets crashing through the floor (more on this in an upcoming post).

What does this mean for equity investors? In a nutshell, it does not look like the kind of regime you would want to be aggressive in taking risk. We will dive deeper into how equity investors should position themselves in a later post.
