## 1. Visibility of system status
- communicate with the user what the system is doing.
- example: the cursor changes from a simple pointer to a finger when you hover over a a hyperlink

## 2. Match between system and the real world
- example: a stove with multiple burners; the location of the burner know should match with the location of the actual burner. The knob on the right controlling a burner on the left doesn't make it intuitive.

## 3. User control and freedom
- example: Undo support; undoing a file delete

## 4. Consistency and standards
- example: if I hover a link on the right and the cursor changes to a finger, then if I hover a link on the left, the cursor should change to the same finger.

## 5. Error prevention
- example: guardrails on the road

## 6. Recognition rather than recall
- minimise the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible

## 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
- shortcuts may speed up the interaction for the expert user.

## 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
- should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.

## 9. Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Error messages should be expressed in plain language.

## 10. Help and documentation
- It may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.
