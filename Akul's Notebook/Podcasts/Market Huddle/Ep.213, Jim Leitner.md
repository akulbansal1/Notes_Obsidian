- The last time Jim was on this [podcast](obsidian://open?vault=Akul's%20Notebook&file=Podcasts%2FMarket%20Huddle%2FEp.179%2C%20Jim%20Leitner)
	- The Fed had just started their hiking cycle. A lot of people though that they wouldn't go that far.
	- Jim was suggesting that the Fed might end up being dramatically being more aggressive than the market priced in.
- "Last year, the clear thing was rates were going to go higher than the market seemed to expect. But the other thing was none of that was reflected in options pricing. You could buy really cheap optionality and just put it away if you wanted to do 1-year Eurodollar futures, you should have made a 100 times your premium"
