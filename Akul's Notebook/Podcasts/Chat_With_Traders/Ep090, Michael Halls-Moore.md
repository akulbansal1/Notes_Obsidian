Author of the Quantstart blog.

- Worked at a tech startup that didn't work out; then as a quant developer in a small equity quant fund.
- Strategy in the quant fund:
	- "We were scouring the internet for lot of alternative data sources. We did use traditional pricing data but we also used a lot of documentation and natural language data"
	- "We would take a lot of blogs and try and mix it into a big pot that would produce signals"
	- "Later on, we also expanded into a sort of fund of fund mentality. [...] We allocated a certain amount of our portfolio to these other funds, a lot of them were CTAs, quant trend-following funds"
- Why leave the fund:
	- "We had difficulty trying to secure the next institutional round of funding. We had friends and family round."
- "A lot of early-stage quant funds are run by ex-Portfolio Managers. They're used to having a lot of IT infrastructure behind them. They can pick up the phone, just ring the IT department when something goes wrong."
	- "They're usually very very good on strategy development, very very good on statistics and portfolio management but they lack infrastructure, deployment skills"
- How are you trading today?
	- "I tend to think on a portfolio level, rather than the individual strategy level"
	- "Trading strategies are abundant"
	- "I tend to stick with some pretty simple stuff. I tend to with Trend-Following and some mean reversion types strategies"

- Trend-Following on shorter time-frames. 
	- In shorter time-frames, "you're competing with a lot of fund that have hug technology budget".
	- "I look into places with capacity constraints"; smaller markets.

- In mean reversion, "I tend to use a lot of time-series analysis. Econometrics time-series analysis, such as co-integration"
	- "I spend a lot of time perhaps using simple trading strategies but spend a lot of time optimising parameters of those strategies"
- Time-series analysis
	- "Is this time-series actually increasing or is it just following a random walk"
	- "Taking historical series and saying 'do the previous days/weeks of data tell me anything about what the likelihood of the next day/week data is going to be'"

- Two camps in Quant Finance:
	1. Traditional statisticians
		- Data analysis and interpreting data
		- bread and butter statistics
	2. Computer scientists
		- Taking huge amounts of data and trying to find patterns in it
	- Machine Learning a marriage of the two worlds
