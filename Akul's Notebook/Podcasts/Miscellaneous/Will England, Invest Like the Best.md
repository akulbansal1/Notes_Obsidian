- "core concept of the multi-manager model is to say 'this should be pure alpha vehicle' and the way to get that is by putting together multiple different types of essentially relative value strategies. That could long-short stock-picking (both from fundamental standpoint and quantitative standpoint) various different forms of macro strategies, volatility trading"
- "technology is a huge huge piece of what we're doing"
	- "the sophistication of the risk systems are very much tied to the sophistications of technology systems"

- GMV: Gross Market Value
	- if you have $100 in a fund, you'd be 100-long, 100-short in a market neutral fund.
- "Collectively, the individual strategies are really looking to make 2-3% on the GMV"
	- "so, if you have 50 equity long-short managers, and $10 Billion balance sheet, you're looking to make couple hundred million dollar P/L off of that as a whole".

- Factor models: style factors (momentum, value, growth, etc. "which are effectively more statistical than anything"); and industry factors (tech, healthcare, industrials, etc.)
	- "let's take that out to a reasonable degree and the reason for that (...) is humans' inability to consistently, not only time the market but to time when is the value factor going to switch, when is the growth factor going to switch, humans just aren't really good at that"
	- "so as a stock picker, let's just isolate out. Focus on stocks-to-stocks; focus on relative value"

- How many people are out there who can generate that 3% on GMV?
	- "It's probably more hundreds than thousands at some level. And when I say that that's less about the technical aspects of the job. You can learn how to model companies. You can learn how to be a quant wizard. You can do all those pieces. But the job of being a PM, whether you're quantitative or fundamental is psychologically extremely taxing because you're going to be wrong basically just as much as you're going to be right".
	- "And that takes a certain psychological profile and that requires training, and I just don't think many humans are wired that way."
	- "probably the multi-manager space, in my opinion, is a bit too crowded at the moment, which is natural in finance"

- Walleye was a options market maker founded in 2005. prop fund. had an existential crisis in 2011-2012 when the returns dried up drastically (didn't lose money but the returns dried up). "we were a $60 million prop firm all over 10 years ago"
	- "when we were starting to build our fundamental equities business, originally, we do that with managed account relationships with external firms because we were too small to even hire people".
	- 2017: "okay we're a $100 million platform. We have multiple different businesses now. We think we have some scale. We've seen what some of the larger multi-managers had done. (...) we effectively hit a $100 million firm with $30 million of expenses, another $20 million to $40 million of variable expenses. So effectively, if we weren't making at least a 50% gross return on capital every single year, actually, the investors, the partners were losing money"
- "I personally was given a lot of responsibility at a young age. I'm only 38 now. So back then in my early 30s - and my partner who's 30 years older than me, gave a lot of responsibility"
- "it's essential for someone in my position to have been a PM. That's for the psychology aspect of it"
- "In quant-landed multi-managers, most of what quant is is equity stat-arb".
	- "So what people are fighting over now is there's the signal aspect, 'is there some new bit of data that could help improve my signal'. But at the same time, our equity stat arb business is running at scale for almost eight years. A lot of the data that they're using has been available really since the '70s. (...) And when you read about Princeton Newport, what they were doing in the '80s, they're talking about fucking value and momentum"
	- "There's definitely quantitative artists that are saying, 'okay, quant, especially that style of equities, or quant investing, is less about finding the thing that no one else has'. (...) So what differentiates people is how you're putting together everything into the soup as one."

- "are there things that you are always looking for when you're interviewing a PM that feel like just necessary conditions of someone that you would hire, the key traits of a PM in this relative game?"
	- "intellectual honesty is the biggest one. (...) They need to really understand why they made money in the past because we're not underwriting the past, we're underwriting on a go-forward basis, which is an obvious statement, but very few people really understand that."
	- "we're not going to hire high-maintenance people. Believe me, there's a lot of high-maintenance people in finance."
