- CIO of Standpoint Asset Management
	- Does macro trend trading with long-only equities investing.

- "Macro to us means top-down and global"
	- "we're looking for trends and opportunities all around the globe"

- Why short soybeans?![[Pasted image 20230619123919.png]]
	- "We track 75 most liquid futures markets in the world [...] run some relatively simple old-school trend rules on it to find supply-demand imbalances and then we take positions in those markets"

- three things they look at:
	1. Price and returns; accounts for 40-45% of the signal
	2. Term structure; accounts for 25-30% 
	3. Liquidity (impacts the size of a trade, not the direction)

- March 2020 experience:
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-19 at 5.04.42 PM.png]]
	- Short energy positions saved them from losses in equities markets in March 2020.

- AI/ML
	- Very interested in AI/ML. "I'm basically a data scientist. I have taken a lot of those classes"
	- "It's very interesting but I'm very skeptical about it"
	- "Data Science and Machine Learning can uncover a lot of things that are there that you don't already know about but they're not creating new things"
	- "It's a lot safer an more durable to go after the structural risk premia that I know to be there that I know how to harvest and that I believe is sustainable than it is to get into the shadow bloody shark-filled waters with all the brilliant data scientists out there that are trying to uncover risk premia we don't know about or fooling themselves into seeing risk premia that aren't really there"

- "exploiting an inefficiency philosophy doesn't appeal to me because it's temporary and they're finite"
	- "on the other hand there are structural risk premia that are psychologically tough but they scale nicely"

- Risk premia you like?
	- primary risk premia that we are going after: taking hedger's risk (trend following)
	- equity market risk premia; we have 50% of our fund in long-only global equity ETFs
		- 8 ETFs: 4 on U.S. stock market and other 4 track developed Europe and developed Asian markets.
		- we allow the allocation to long-only to fluctuate. It can go as high as 2/3rd or as low as 1/3rd "depending upon whether we're in a bull market that's pulling that allocation higher or a bear market that's pulling that allocation lower"
	- treasury bills (risk premium over cash)
- these things are all uncorrelated with each other.

- "you can't create new risk premia out of thin air". "Using AI to uncover risk premia no one knows about is probably a bad bet"
