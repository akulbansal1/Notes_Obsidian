- Founder, managing partner and CIO of Balyasny Asset Management. $21B AUM, 2000 people.

- was a broker in the early days, got a job at Schonfeld as a prop trader.
	- the base pay was 0 but got trained by senior traders there.
- "I started with very short-term trading. In the morning, you would look for reversal trades where the market would open up and you look for stocks that weren't trading well versus the market and industries that were showing relative weakness versus the market. Learn how to spot those early and they might be up because the overall tape was up and you had short opportunities and then as market would settle in or sometimes reverse, those would really significantly outperform and you try to spot those within the first 15 or 30 minutes of the day and capture those sentiment swings. Afternoon, it was typically more momentum type trading."
- built his own team at the prop fund. "hired the first class of 4 in 1997, hired the next 4 in 1998. I assigned people sectors and group of stocks to manage and allocated risk to them". hiring the first analyst in 1999, wanted to manage more capital and hold positions for longer. hired more experienced sector head portfolio managers.
- Before bringing an analyst, not really focused on fundamentals. "I was focused on change in fundamentals and news flow"

- "we engage in lots of different strategies but fundamental long-short equity trading is still the largest strategy but that's down from 100% of the risk in the early days to (even 5 years ago, 85%) now it's about 45% of the risk"
	- "built out large businesses in macro"
	- "in the process of building out lots of different quantitative-type strategies"
