- "found themselves in print and on the silver screen as protagonists in Michael Lewis' *The Big Short*"
- Frontpoint Capital (Steve Carell's hedge fund in *The Big Short*). "What did you guys figure out that worked back then for a long-short equity hedge fund?"
	- "That really was the heyday, when longs could work, shorts could work. You had more imperfect information and if you were the first one to get it, you had an edge. [...] we did that successfully a bunch of years before 2006"
	- What they were doing in those days was very na√Øve compared to today, in terms of the risk management process, essentially just looking at gross exposure and no factor exposures, etc.
- Started Seawolf
	- was a sector fund. focused on financials.
	- they were down 8% in 2016. One of the three partners retired. so Porter and Vincent decided to join Citadel.
- Worked at Citadel for 1.5 years.
	- "one of the things that really struck me was: it's not investing. there's actually no part of investing to it; it's managing a bunch of tickers within a risk framework"
	- "there was this concept of ageing. This name's in the book for 8 months, you guys gotta sell it"
	- "Vin and I realised about an hour and a half into being there that we were in the wrong place"
- volatility targeting as a risk management process
	- "it guides us in many respects" but we have to be careful
	- "if you work at these shops, it took me while to figure it out, but almost all of them are 90-95% of the time long short-term momentum [...]. If more and more capital is being deployed in these strategies, more and more capital is long short-term momentum, once you think it about it that way, it's very easy to see why we're seeing the vol we're seeing today"
	- "we have outsized performance when the VIX spikes. It's been a great couple years and now we're back to VIX 14. Market's at all-time-highs, VIX is at all-time-lows and everyone again wants to be buying stocks, which is obviously the wrong answer"
- "we tend to be value-oriented investors. [...] We decided we need to be more generalists"
	- "we were factor cognisant but we didn't want to be factor controlled"
- "what we are is value investors"
	- "Even when we were doing Financial Service only, the average P/E was 5. I think now our average P/E is 3. And we love finding little gems in the middle of nowhere"
	- "we had 12-baggers last year in some of these names"
	- "we always start with the balance sheet. What does the balance sheet look like? How much can we lose here? What happens if the income statement inflects? And it all becomes circular because the income statement inflects, the cash flows get better, the debt goes down, the cash goes up, then they start buybacks and share count goes down. That's iterative nature of the stuff we're looking for"
	- "And being patient. Market's up 2% today. I just don't worry about that and you sit around and feel like that's what Buffett does. He doesn't worry about data. He finds good companies; he looks for great investments. That's a little bit more of what we're doing than trying to scalp pennies. You cannot beat the Citadel analysts, there's 50 of them, all looking at the same name and back-book behind it"

- Hedge fund industry
	- "consists of all the big levered funds and then a couple of the large hedge funds and every else in between looks like a family office"
	- "I don't think there's any institutional appetite for a fund like ours"
	- equity markets: "with the 0 day expiration options and all these computers. Is there a place for humans? What is the use of a human these days in markets. That's my bearish look on the equity hedge fund portfolio side"
	- fixed income: "passive is one of the stupidest ideas ever in fixed income but in equities, it's worked"
	- Excluding the top hedge funds, i.e. Citadel, Millennium, "I think the rest of the hedge fund alternative industry (and I'm ignore Private Equity for a second), we have to be smaller, more nimble, more patient and we also have to accept to a certain extent that volatility is a construct that's going to happen as a result of the way you're managing money to produce outsized return"
- "last year we were pretty decently +150% but we had a 30% drawdown at one point in the year and for us it's part of the game. You just gotta control your leverage"
