#trend_following_podcast #AQR 

- AQR runs approximately $3-4B in trend following.

- AQR has evolved over time (to improve Sharpe Ratio of trend strategies) by "trying to add other types of return streams that are not simple pure price trend"
	- Chosen to exclude strategies that tend to perform poorly during equity market stress (like risk premia, currency carry, etc.) from trend offerings.
	- 2 things "we like that both keep the properties of trend-following and help improve the Sharpe Ratio of a trend strategy"
		1. Economic trend following: looking at macroeconomic data and the trends in that to forecast price movements going forward rather than just past price returns.
		2. Alternative market trend following: application of trend following to much less trafficked markets

- "when thinking about how to make a trend strategy have a better Sharpe [...] we just want to be thoughtful about trying to make sure that the things that we include enhance, at least retain, the same convex profile"

- Trends happen due to underreaction to economic data
	- Looking at past prices is one way of measuring underreaction "but looking the economic data itself that drives prices could be another way to measure it"
	- Example: starting of 2022, there was a big divergence between price trend following and economic trend following signals in the equity space. Price trends wanted to be long equities however, rising inflationary and tigher monetary policy trends that had been forming throughout the last half of 2021. Economic trend signals were saying these economic conditions tend to be bad for equity markets (and bond markets, too).

- [[A Half Century of Macro Momentum]] talks about economic trend following.
	- "we are planning to put out a new piece in the next few months that specifically looks at economic trend following as a standalone strategy"

- "In the futures space, we find that mean reversion and valuation metrics tend to be more useful when it comes to applying them in a relative value context"
	- "comparing one equity index versus another, comparing one country's bond market versus another". They use these kind of strategies in their relative value macro trading.
	- "but when it comes to directional macro [...] our research so far has shown that long-term mean reversion are less profitable"

- "we do run broad mutli-strategy alternative portfolios and trend is a pretty important component. It is one of multiple alternative return streams that we think are diversifying to traditional portfolios and diverifying to other alternative portfolios and the convexity profile is quite unique to trend"
- there is a trade-off between higher Sharpe ratio and convexity profile. "Multi-strat AQR fund is a bit more tilted towards towards the higher Sharpe, a bit less weight toward the convex profile, whereas for trend it's much more balanced between the two even a bit more lilted toward higher convex"
