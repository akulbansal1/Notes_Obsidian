- Trend Following on alternative markets.
- There is a burst of volatility before a trend reverses, "that's why rapid vol scaling is so important".
- examples of alternative markets:
	- regional carbon emissions in the U.S.
	- Malaysian Palm Oil
	- Emerging market Interest Rate Futures

- "The focus is very purely on alternative markets"
- "In general, we like markets that don't have extreme kurtosis".
	- "With volatility scaling, you can manage the vol. You can manage skew by choosing the right trend models to a degree"

- how do you pick markets?
	- "We very much like interest rates swaps markets around the world"
	- "we try to get as much exposure to power markets, globally"
	- "We tend to not emphasise equities very much. It's our experience that CTAs that delve deeply into equities don't usually do as well as specialised equity managers"
	- "very involved with the Chinese commodities markets. They're liquid, they're big."

- "We have a whole range of smooth momentum and breakout, or jump momentum"
	- "in some of the markets that can move far and fast, we use a bit more breakout type systems so that you don't stay on the wrong side of a big fast move for too long"
	- "there are better and worse ways to measure volatility for volatility scaling, and we think we probably do it in probably one of the best ways, because we're using range estimators of volatility as opposed to what we think are much cruder, close to close measure"
- "We allocate differently. We are trying to maximise the diversification benefit in our book and that means that our capacity is smaller than others and we allocate more to a broad range of markets"
	- "We are not trying to be a $10B fund [...] This program is going to be $3-3.5B program when it's completely full and that keeps us nimble"

- There are some differences in the way they trade markets.
	- "We trade FX relatively quickly. The way we trade FX, it acts as a risk buffer against slower moving markets that we can't trade as quickly. The return to trading FX is not that brilliant but the marginal effect on the portfolio is very good"
	- "There's a bit difference from sector to sector"
	- "We're probably quicker in Chinese commodities than almost any of our competitors but the models are very similar". 
- "You don't want to be overfitting. You allow yourself a little bit of room maybe trade this sector a little faster than that sector or to include maybe more breakout type models in this place as opposed to that place".

- how do you manage correlation risk?
	- "we end up having a lot of small positions because we try to spread the risk out"
	- "we're not using some delicate covariance analysis where you're pivoting this against that. It almost has a bit of 1/N quality after taking certain factors into account"
	- "we do not take a significant amount of equity beta in our program"

- has an office in London and Abu Dhabi
	- himself lives in Abu Dhabi
	- "10 people there, 10 people here"
