- Traded in Solomon Brothers and other banks for a few years. Went on to start his own hedge fund in 1990. Druckenmiller, and PTJ were the big swinging dicks back then.
- Kept managing his hedge fund for 10 years. Had great first few years but "things started tailing off"
	- "I just could never get used to trading billions the same way as I traded millions"
- "I think any good trader can make 50-100% on a million. You do that on a billion, you're a legend"
	- "I found it very easy to have very good returns […] 50%+ a year on 50 million, 70 million, 100 million but I found it almost impossible to pull the trigger on an extra zero or two"
- "I think that that's something people don't do. They don't look at where the real danger points, the pivot points of the market are, and structure their trades around [those points]"
	- "I haven't found that the market prices my pivot points correctly. In fact, I've made most of money by doing exactly that, having the right strike in the combination of my trade"
	- The 'right strike' is a function of technical analysis. "I find technical analysis indispensable, not because it tells me where something is going to go to […] but what it does say is to give the market a chance if it does this this or that"
- Looks at a lot of ratio charts (calls them spreads) of similar assets, like NDX versus RUT.
- The yield curve has been steepening. "If you get the [yield] curve right, that actually tells you a lot and also the fact that long bonds have moved so little relatively to where they could go, and that tells me the Fed is managing this process extremely well. They don't, yet, need to do an operation twist. And that gives me the confidence to buy the extreme dip in Nasdaq"
	- "The [yield] curve, I think, dictates what these [equity] indices do"
	- Nasdaq is very sensitive to rates because it's heavy on growth stocks. The discount rate matters a lot in their case. "Since equities are perpetual bonds, it's the long end which matters to the Nasdaq"
	- "You're looking for the growth of the earnings in the future, not now, in the future"
- "While the curve is bull steepening, there's absolutely no chance that the Nasdaq can be a leader"
- What are some of the mistakes investors/traders make:
	- "people don't look at what the spreads are telling them at that point in time"
	- "I computerized the whole thing. I look at thousands of components and I put it all together in a score, from -100 to 0 to +100. When you have a very strong positive score, thousands of spreads are telling you one thing and that is that the equities are likely to outperform fixed income, on a relative basis" #idea_macro_trading 
	- "It is almost suicide, when the market is down 10-12%, to go short; that is precisely what happened a couple weeks ago when we were trading at 3200 in the S&Ps. People were really bearish and the spreads were telling you exactly the opposite"
- Advice for young investors/traders:
	- "have a few years, 4-5-6 years of very good grounding in every single aspect and every single market from FX to Fixed Income to Swaps, everything. You need to understand where the potential, really difficult, pitfalls are"
	- "Take losses quickly and to let the profits run"
