- The last time Jim was on this [podcast](obsidian://open?vault=Akul's%20Notebook&file=Podcasts%2FMarket%20Huddle%2FEp.179%2C%20Jim%20Leitner)
	- The Fed had just started their hiking cycle. A lot of people though that they wouldn't go that far.
	- Jim was suggesting that the Fed might end up being dramatically being more aggressive than the market priced in.
- "Last year, the clear thing was rates were going to go higher than the market seemed to expect. But the other thing was none of that was reflected in options pricing. You could buy really cheap optionality and just put it away if you wanted to do 1-year Eurodollar futures, you should have made a 100 times your premium"
- Curation of ideas is important. How do you do that? Sell-side research, bloomberg?
	- "I use all the resources but I kind of know who's good at it. For example: on the carry stuff, I look at MacroHive"
- toggle.ai is a good resource for sourcing ideas.
- The big picture stuff doesn't get too impacted by AI. As trading becomes more efficient, we'll have to get more long-term.
	- "Systems are not set-up to take longer time-frame bets because other risks show up during that period of time"
	- "Try to do something where you have a 3-week, 3-months, 3-years time horizon. Now, you're not competing with anybody. Now, it's just basically are you right are you wrong"
