- trades risk parity beta, alternative risk premia, and managed futures
- "we use carry divided by recent measures of volatility"
- "once you've got beta right, we think there's a lot that you can do in alternative beta"
	- "there's stuff you can do in between beta and alpha: factors"

- what trend speeds are you using?
	- the problem with long-term signals is that it's difficult to get a negative correlation to risk assets when risk assets aren't doing so well.
	- "we're exponentially decaying our signals and we're using signals with half-lives from 10 days to about half a year"

- "carry is informative if you want to time beta"
	- "when we neutralise each asset relative to its own asset class, we no longer have beta in the cross section of each of these asset classes' returns. we've taken the beta out and we've got a market-neutral sub-portfolio. and once we do that, carry is no longer predictive through time"

- "carry is more informative in the cross-section"
	- "within each asset class, we're normalising [carry signals] relative to the middle of carry over risk"
	- carry portfolio is market neutral in each asset class but the entire portfolio goes where the carry is higher.

- Creating a portfolio of multi-factors:
	- integrating factors make more sense in theory but mixed approach is much better.
	- mixed approach has more breadth.
	- "it turns out that when you're integrating a bunch of signals and one of them is low vol, what we found is that the resulting portfolio had a real low-vol bias. It did not feel as if it was capturing all the factors."

- "if you've got a bunch of related markets, you can use them to filter each other's recent performance and create a less noisy signal for trend and that less noisy signal will be more informative in terms of which direction you allocate to a market"

- speed of carry?
	- "we take the closest observable point on the yield curve that we can use"
