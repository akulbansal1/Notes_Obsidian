- Background
	- started on fundamental equities research role
	- now in the quant world; brings the accounting side of things to quantitative investing

- "How do you make Fame French make sense to people who pick one stock at a time?"
	- A bond with a low yield is generally going to be less riskier. Growth stocks are trading at really tiny earnings yields; that makes it a less riskier; "you start to see how you can then think about these growth stocks trading on these really high multiples is actually being priced for very low expected returns"
- As a company matures, it goes from growth to quality to value. And its cost of capital rises at its tech gets old.
- An early stage growth stock has the potential to grow a lot but the quality stock has probably realised a lot of what it could achieve. Buying a quality stock is a bit like buying the growth stock and selling a really OTM call; you lose that potential of super upside but in return you get a little bit more yield.
- "I use this question to anchor my thinking" : let's say a fundamental analyst thinks a stock is going up because the market is under-appreciating quality. I say, "Do you mean that cashflow is going up at the same multiple or that the multiple needs to go up?"
- Quants have relied on diversification to avoid having to get into the nitty gritty stuff. Where is the line between discretionary fundamental and a quant?
	- "You're a quant when you can't intervene to change the rules, and you're discretionary when you can"
- How much of those nitty-gritty stuff are cross-sectional details versus idiosyncratic improvements?
	- fundamental analysts help quant analysts by identifying false positives  
- Equity reversion strategies, for example, have had a structural change in the best way to apply that strategy.
	- Story of equity reversion starts out with a discretionary manager being a bit opportunistic: this theme is overplayed, take profits; this stock has corrected too much, buy it.
	- Then the quants sweep in and can identify those stocks a bit more easily, and you start to look at it relative to sector/region. Worked well through the 90s. 
	- "This can be enhanced statistically using PCA. Stop thinking about sector/region, start thinking about PCA. Strip out enough PCAs and control for your signal, well then this becomes profitable again".
	- When PCA stops working, the next thing will be a better understanding of the fundamentals.
- Combining factors well
	- Been tried a lot is in your factor zoo, machine learning world. thousand papers on SSRN which just throw the Gradient Boosting algorithm at 200 different factors, Deutsche Bank has been doing that since 2013.
- Is the use of fundamentals to make up for poorly designed statistical models. If you made the models more sophisticated, newer techniques, got better data, etc., would a purely statistical approach at the end of day end up being superior?
	- There has been a study where they showed that fundamental analysts are not good at predicting the absolute returns of the stocks, but they are good at ranking the stocks.
- "A pure extraction of the premium won't perform as well as a bad extraction because the bad extraction is more likely to be a muddied multi-factor"
