- alternative markets CTA. 500 markets ranging from Turkish cross currency swaps to French power markets.
- Doug's background:
	- mathematician by training.
	- started out in Fixed Income and Macro, Goldman Sachs, Greenwich Capital; used a lot of term structure models, volatility models, and pre-payment models. did a lot of Mortgage-Backed Securities.
	- another area: cross-sectional systematic Macro; imitating the style of Quant Equity Long-Short; using factors to establish positions.
	- more recently: time-series Macro, trend-following CTA style. "It's not just about the trend, it's about what volatility does at various stages of the trend"
- who has been the most influential on you?
	- Bob Litterman, at Goldman Sachs; "was a pioneer in the use of Bayesian vector autoregression, this is where you use a very complicated model and let the data speak then regularise the model by imposing Bayesian priors"
- "In the case of trend following, one of the key elements is that when trends die, there tends to be a burst of volatility. That's a fact that I believe will be true in the future too"
- "If you want to put together a team that's really going to succeed, the success must be shared"
- Why trend-following?
	- "I've been around for a long time and I've seen a lot of stuff and I have an appreciation for how wild and crazy the tails can be and most people who haven't experienced it don't understand"
	- "Too much knowledge can paralyse you if you're selling the tails"
	- "Nothing has proved so evergreen and resilient and consistent through many regimes as trend-following. It may not be the highest Sharpe Ratio strategy but it has such a nice positive skew"
	- "The bad thing the style is the sharpe ratio isn't very high"
	- "Can you imagine a Sharpe ratio 1 strategy where you have a big positive skew and when dislocations occur you make a lot of money. That'll be a very very attractive thing indeed"

- alternative markets example:
	- French electricity, Columbian interest rates, Turkish cross currency swaps, CDS
	- "we select our markets to be very orthogonal. For example: we do not trade U.S. interest rates swaps"
	- "we have a lot of exposure in emerging markets"
	- "our portfolio is not extremely illiquid at all. it's just an operationally difficult portfolio of assets"

- synthetic markets?
	- "we do, to a very limited degree"
	- "you gotta be careful about trying to trade trends on the things that are not really directional things. On the other hand, you can sometimes find combinations of assets that trend better than unitary singleton assets"

- "you tend to get a better ratio of directional movement relative to meaningless chop" in alternative markets
	- "when the market participants are not just a bunch of speculators, there tends to be better market behaviour"
	- "we've been adding 50-75 new markets a year. I think we've added over 50 so far this year and we continue to have our markets for new ones"

- filtering markets
	- we don't want too regulated markets.
	- "we don't apply trend to pegged regimes"
	- don't need vast amount of data because we apply relatively similar models across markets of similar liquidity "but you do need a deep understanding of the liquidity of the market, how it varies over time"
	- understand the idiosyncrasies of markets. credit spreads, for example, widens quickly and tightens slowly and therefore if you're trading credit spreads, your model needs to take this into account.

- "I think the reason that developed market trend-following is less attractive than it used to be is:"
	- "correlations among assets got higher, particularly during Quantitative Easing"
	- "given the debt burden that you see in the developed economies, there are very very high levels of sovereign and corporate debt and central bankers are very keen not to have a deflationary collapse. What this means is that they're trying to stop out trends using monetary/fiscal policies"

- do you need to make changes in the model to trade alternative markets?
	- "we have to be mindful of the liquidity"
	- developed market trend-followers make certain changes (trade slower, introduce carry, selling volatility, collecting risk premia) to overcome the low sharpe ratio. 

- portfolio construction
	- "we use a tree structure for constructing the portfolio and the starting point is the idea of having a similar amount of risk in all of the branches, in all of the twigs"
	- "in addition, we use a method of dynamic gearing where the changing correlations are detected as changing levels of volatilities from different branches of the tree and the system automatically adjusts so that the volatility that we're delivering moves toward the desired level"

- What do quants typically get wrong and what do non-quants get wrong?
	- "Quants do not appreciate how non-stationary the world is. They worship data a little too much". In a data-rich environment like HFT, that problem is mitigated but when you're in macro, the data is too sparse and the issue of non-stationarity becomes very important. "People do too much unconditional estimation. An outside reversal is an interesting technical signal but outside reversals primarily matter in the late stages of certain kinds of trends but much of the rest of the time, they don't mean anything"
	- Non-quants "have trouble sizing the trades. They have trouble often-times spotting the factor exposures that they have"
