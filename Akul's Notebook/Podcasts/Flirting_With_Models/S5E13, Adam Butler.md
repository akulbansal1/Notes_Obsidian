- "You've got a much better chance of converging on an optimal forecast if you're drawing on information [signals] from a very wide variety of models of different points on that strong versus weak priors, different points on that simple to complex spectrum, drawing from different sources of information, forecasting over a variety of different models, employing a variety of different experimental designs, employing a variety of different type of model creation methods, on a wide variety of different instruments. To me, that's by far the best approach to ensure that your forecasts are going to converge in general on something that is generally correct".
