- Focuses on selling options that capture the volatility risk premium.
- "David believes markets are ultimately efficient and therefore foregoes using any sort of active signal".

- David has two hedge funds:
	1. Takes a beta portfolio and uses various income strategies as an overlay. "The mandate is simply to outperform.
	2. Stripped out a 0 DTE strategy. Intraday options.
	- 100% SPX index options.
		- Entering puts and calls and "we put a stop loss on to manage risk and we're entering multiple times throughout the day just to increase the number of occurrences".

- "We enter delta neutral at entry. It doesn't stay delta neutral depending on which way the market moves but the idea is we're going to enter delta neutral no matter what the market is doing".
	- `Sounds a lot like the 9:20 straddle strategy; stop loss on option price and delta exposure after a move`.

- "Generally speaking, lower delta equates to higher win rate".
	- "At some point if you go low enough [low delta] that win rate is going to peak above what you need for breakeven".
