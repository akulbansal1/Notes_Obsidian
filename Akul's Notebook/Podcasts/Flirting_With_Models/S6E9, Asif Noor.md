- "Last 7-10, we've been focusing on building non-price-based strategies and sort of plethora of what I would call convergent strategies and using data sources that are non-price-based and price-based"
	- "my focus currently is managing global macro strategies, relative value macro strategies at Aspect" Capital.

- Changes in the last 20 years
	- "medium-term frequency to build macro models was okay. Monthly frequency data was fine, monthly rebalancing was fine and the breadth of assets have increased as well"
- multi-strategy program:
	- "not a combination of all the models we have at Aspect [...] because we're trying to deliver a smooth consistent return profile with diversification to any of the risk factors and more importantly to equity markets, to bonds markets, and trend and macro"
	- "the way I judge an alpha signal is really by correlation of its return profile to other things like equity beta, for example."

- process of introducing/removing alpha signals
	- red flag: "when you stop introducing newer models or sun-setting older models"
	- 8-10 researchers investigating 30-40 ideas years. "hit rate is not very high. you're roughly introducing 3-5 models a year and unfortunately, a lot of the models are on watchlist so we'll end up retiring 2-3 models a year but the process of retiring is a lot harder than introducing new ones"
- choose between 1) new, independent alpha signal but it's low accuracy (low confidence) or 2) slightly enhance an existing alpha signal but that enhancement is high confidence:
	- "I would pick the enhancement of the existing strategy"
	- "I already don't believe in backtest much right now"
- "the key to generating new signals is bringing new talent, new ways of thinking, avoiding groupthink"
- "we're not just looking at historic inflation data, we can actually use now-casting to predict what inflation will be or what growth will be"
