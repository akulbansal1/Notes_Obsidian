- CIO of Man AHL
- Corey: Key evolutions in quant landscape over the last 20 years?
	- Back in 2001, we were doing research the whole day, wearing suits, sitting in front of a computer. Nowadays everyone is wearing hoodies and trainers and most people don't even bother going to office anymore.
	- "the bar has become higher and the bar is likely to continuously get higher"
	- Initially, Russell was a cynic in terms of beating the market or investment strategies. He was of the belief that market price encapsulated everything, more or less.
		- Whenever he came up with a strategy, he was thinking to himself "this is never going to last"
		- Still has that cynicism
- Corey: Research agenda, long term goals?
	- "I would distinguish between large scale projects and general predictive research"
	- In the case of general predictive research, "that should be as free-form as possible. You give as much freedoms to researchers as you can. There's some accountability to that and people know that that's their job, to find new sources of alpha and to work on signals"
	- In the case of large-scale projects: requires investing in capabilities, requires planning, and commitments and investment from the firm. "Our approach is generally to go bottom-up for ideas. Teams will brainstorm what capabilities they could deliver, what new initiatives they might want to work on"
- Sub-strategy units within Man AHL:
	1. Core: "looks after very scalable futures and forward strategies"
		- Trend, risk premia, esoteric macro strategies
	2. Specialist: "more alternative, either asset classes or strategy types"
		- Options trading, machine learning efforts, credit trading, interest rate swaps
		- You need specialist market knowledge and specialist technology
	3. Equities:
	4. Fast trading: "NOT super-fast, high frequency nanosecond stuff. sub two weeks holding period"
		- Holding period of hours and upwards
		- "Objective is not just to create alpha on its own right but also to improve the way we execute across the platform"

- Corey: Investments into execution is very important.
	- "We spent a lot on a relative basis on having our own algos in the futures space"
	- "I remember at the time people going 'well, we're spending all this money on this one small part of the system and why are we not doing more on signal research"
	- "The signal research decays. The platform stuff, where you really invest in capabilities, that has a decay rate that's much much slower"

- Corey: How to avoid groupthink in the research process?
	- Groupthink is, without a doubt, the biggest challenge in our industry. Probably the biggest challenge of many research-driven industries, pharmaceuticals is the classic example.
	- "personally the best teams I've worked in have been mixed, from a gender perspective, they've also been mixed from an educational background perspective. So not just mathematicians, not just economists, not just physicists but a bit more breadth and ideas can from anywhere"
	- Man AHL has really benefited from the introduction of Man GLG, a discretionary pm-based outfit. `This shows the strength of combining quantitative analysis with discretionary trading, something even Brent Donnelly in his book [Alpha Trader] talks about as "the ideal model for discretionary alpha capture in the current era"`

- One thing Man AHL has started to do is to say to the researcher and the reviewers "what do you think the Sharpe ratio of this is going to be in live trading?"
	- You do this for tens, hundreds of signals and you start to build up a data set.
	- You can then spot patterns, i.e., people are particularly good at this, people are over optimistic, etc.

- Corey: "Sometimes the most successful strategies and models don't back test very well". How do you create confidence in your researchers/reviewers for signals and strategies where back test may be lacking or entirely impossible?
	- Don't work in isolation. Work in a group, take a few different opinions.
- Key elements to risk management:
	1. "Constructing portfolios that themselves have sensible and well-observed risk limits"
	2. Dynamic exposure control. "I need to be able to react to changes in market conditions and recognize the fact that risk levels in the markets change over time and I need systems to be able to change with them"

- Corey: Market are a reflexive system. If everyone starts to adopt these dynamic risk controls, it might have destabilizing effects on the market as a whole. If everyone's systematically selling at the first sign of a drop in diversification, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Vol-targeting funds (CTAs, Risk-Parity) are contributing to the increased vol of vol we're seeing in the markets. Do you think that this is an unfortunate arms race that could be destabilizing markets?
	- "Market, to my mind, are as inefficient now as they were 20 years ago. It's just inefficiencies might move around a bit. And more capital chases an inefficiency the less you're likely to see of it"
	- "the AUM and the trading volumes that would cause pressure on the market aren't doing so that's overpowering markets"
	- "In none of those events, do I think that, huge moves have been caused because of CTAs or Risk-Parity"
