- Corey: "Anyone entering quantitative investing has to read that book [[Expected Returns]]". It is an absolute bible for all the stuff that used to work in quantitative investing.
	- A lot of style premia in this book has struggled a lot over the last decade.
	- "even if you have got the solid in your ideas, and you want to be faithful on them, […] you're going to keep running to stay still, need continuous R&D, somewhat better models, portfolio construction tools, execution skills, to maintain the edge, and you should do all this while guarding against overfitting".
	- "Some styles did have a good decade, like defensive styles had an excellent decade. Momentum depends on which type [you look at]. Value and Carry type of strategies disappointed".

- Corey: "we've just seen value and trend, which were written off by many as just dead rise from the ashes […]. What's changed, that's all of a sudden brought these styles back to life?"
	- "all long-only assets have been expensive at the same time, because the common part of the discount rate has been record low.
	- "long-short strategies like alternative risk premia style premium, they are different from long only premium, in the sense that low cash yields or rising cash yields in this discount rate washes out between long and short legs. So they are zero duration assets, you could say and that makes them more resistant to fed tightening and otherwise rising yield".
	- "I think we have got a decent case in saying that there's runway for some more good performance. […] value spreads are still wide".
	- "typically inflation-related developments are more gradual, and that is very convenient for trend type strategies".

- Corey: since you wrote Expected Returns, "were there areas in which you gained further confidence? And were there areas in which perhaps you've changed your mind?"
	- "my core beliefs haven't changed".
	- "But there are some of these fields. So I become more humble about tactical timing, even more appreciative of the power of strategic diversification".
	- "there's been a greater appreciation of the importance and difficulty of patience".
	- "I especially like strategies that combine positive long run rewards with some help in bad times. So trend and defensive have sort of become more of my favourites in this".

- Corey: "markets have always been a mix between a long term weighing machine and a short term voting machine. And that some of the financialisation and commoditisation of access to different styles, and changing market participants has made that voting machine perhaps a bit more violent than it used to be. But I don't think it's so overwhelming that the weighing machine never comes into effect. […] you should remain diversified and exposed to positive risk premium assets. And that's probably the best most people can do. […] a 4% move in the S&P today may not mean what is used to two decades ago".
- Corey: AQR has "really helped teach the world about factors and style premia and helped convince the world that these were positive expected return styles that people should diversify into. […] at what point do you become so convincing and gather so many assets in these styles that you create a crowding effect that erodes the premium themselves?"
	- "I do think that there still seems to be pretty natural balance in the market between people who like these types of things and who don't, and then we get fluctuations in that balance over time".

- Who is on the other side of these risk premia?
	- "the most surprising result is this that that one could see that for the defensive strategy, hedge funds were the main other side that that we could identify".
	- "valuations are the most useful crowding measure".
	- "hedge funds and short sellers. And there is this weird resultant, they are indeed, they make sense that they are useful crowding indicators, but in practice, following their positioning has been pretty good idea. […] if you are trying to insure yourself against crowding problems, imagining scenarios through that lens, you are going to pay very expensive insurance premium. You're going against smart money hoping that that's going to help you in a particular episode, and that just happens so rarely that I don't think it's a good idea".

- Corey: "do fundamental managers who tend to rely on [factor analysis] more than quant managers who might build their own signals, does that end up creating unintentional factor crowding among cohort of fundamental managers potentially, into the almost identical definitions and characteristics of a factor?"
	- There "is surprisingly much divergence among systematic managers, different types of ways of doing value can be quite different. Also, momentum actually like can be".
- Corey: "do you think that the rise of passive indexing can lead to fewer people making cross sectional pricing errors being sort of the sucker on the other side, and therefore lead over time to smaller opportunities for that sort of cross sectional mispricing?"
	- "it could be that market pricing may have become more or less efficient, really, depending on whether the index flows are replacing the amateur or this supposedly expert delegated manager [who does a whole lot of fundamental analysis]. So I summarise it to say, it's unclear whether the patsy or the shark has left the table".

- Tail hedging is a costly way of hedging the portfolio unless you have some secret sauce.
	- "I do think tail hedging is very costly, even the good ones who have a good track record. And that could be poor skill, you can't really tell".

- Corey: "is there any clear reason why the prospects for trend following going forward should be meaningfully better than they were over the last decade?"
	- Refers to [[You Can't Always Trend When You Want]].  There were "abnormally short trends in 2010s".
	- "central banks were trying to curtail big macro trends and that hurt both macro managers and trend followers".

- Corey: "would you expect style premia to exist in crypto? And would you be surprised if they did or did not?"
	- "absolutely expect to see patterns like value, momentum, and low risk effects there".
- Corey: "what would make you give up on style premia? Is there anything that would make you say the evidence is clear, either empirically or theoretically, that I need to walk away from these" #idea_factor_investing 
	- "I'm not gonna lose my conviction with a few bad years".
	- "the diversification argument, how you cane double you Sharpe ratios by combining a few styles if they are uncorrelated and double again if you apply them in many asset classes, so those thing they are strong rooted convictions".
	- "for me to give up on this […] would require a combination of economic rationale, why the time is up, and some compelling empirical evidence which could be in sort of embarrassingly long time of disappointing performance, or higher transaction costs eroding the opportunity, or maybe correlations becoming less friendly".
