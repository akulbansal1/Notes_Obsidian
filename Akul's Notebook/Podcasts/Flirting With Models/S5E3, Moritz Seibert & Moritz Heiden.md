- Seibert: trend following trader since many years
	- "over the years, I've migrated my trend following trading more and more back towards the basics, to the very raw and pure form of trend following"
	- 95% of the people will find it too hard to stick to a trend following system
	- When you present the output of a trend following system to somebody, they will immediately complain about the choppiness of the equity curve. "There must be a better of doing that. This has too much of a drawdown. This has too many down years. This has too many down months in a row"
	- Then you try and put lipstick on your trend following pig. Seibert did this 15 years ago. "I was using too many parameters. I was trying to find new systems and different entries and exits, over-optimizing"
	- "I think you should trade as many markets as possible but they have to be liquid and they don't have to be the same"
	- "if you can find uncorrelated, independent markets, wheat and natural gas and equities and bonds, those are great"
	- On signals, "I think it's easy to over-optimize the thing. You have moving averages, […] breakouts, […] regression lines, […] simple momentum, […] volatility breakouts, bollinger bands. […] I trade breakouts, price breakouts"
	- On exits, "I use an initial stop and I use a trailing exit. That's it. Of course you could find different exit points, exit the position in stages. I don't get a lot of benefit out of it"
	- On time horizons, "I trade relatively long term. Not super long term but relatively long term and yes you can mix things and there's a benefit of doing that. If you combine a medium term trend following speed with a longer term trend following speed, you will get in and out of trends […]. There's a little bit of diversification benefit from that. I stay away from the super-fast stuff, like short term trend following. Trading costs are high, slippages are high and it actually, over the long run, it doesn't really perform as well as the long term stuff"
	- On portfolio construction, "again there, I'm really back to the basics. When I take a position, I have a risk budget for that position and that depends on the market, […] volatility, average true range behaviour"
	- Once a trade is open, he doesn't touch the position unless it hits his stop or his exit.
- Heiden: creating spreads, based on seasonality (essentially creating synthetic markets) was a revelation that is not talked about enough on the academic side.
- #idea_spread_trading Hoffstein: "some of the synthetic markets you construct is actually looking at the same market but rolled on a different schedule. So, for example, oil rolled quarterly or monthly or half-year roll cycles"
	- Seibert: "nobody is forcing you trade the front contract. So I thought about […] let's create 12 different crude oil markets, the front, the second, the third and all the way down to the 12th. […] This is not yet a synthetic market, this is just a single outright market that are rolled differently".
	- Seibert: "I started playing around with these things and I could get nothing to work. Like all the simple ideas that I had, creating a spread and subtracting one market from another and subtracting returns from another and all of these things".
	- Seibert: "And then I looked at cointegration. So this is something I'm not using for the outright trend-following system. […] But when you look at markets together, cointegration is a thing."
	- Seibert (on difference b/w cointegration and correlation): "Say you have Crude go up 1% everyday and you have NatGas go up 0.5% go up everyday. That is a linear relationship that would result in perfect positive correlation. But because Crude goes up 1% everyday and NatGas only 0.5%, over time Crude will outperform Natgas and when you look at their time series, there will be a spread. So those markets, in these examples, will be positively correlated but they will not cointegrated. They would only be cointegrated when the spread in their prices is stationary. […] So I looked at markets and created different combinations, now the computer is doing it and essentially I'm looking for breakouts in cointegration structures and that would then signal me to take a spread trade but I'm using the same rules".
	- Heiden: "cointegration is mostly used on mean reversion or pairs trade. […] my idea on why it works for Moritz is that he is basically introducing some mean reversion feature in a trend following concept"
	- Seibert: "It's not a mean reversion feature at all. I am actually looking for a break in that cointegration structure. So something is cointegrated now and it stops being cointegrated, which means those time series start to diverge again and I'm looking to get on to that trend".

**the episode now only talks about crypto and not trend following so I stopped listening**
