- Since the founding of the firm in 1972, it was mostly trend-following focused.
	- Started seeing itself as a systematic fund manager and not just as a trend-follower.
	- In 2003, it was the early days of building out a more diverse manager in the sense of involving many more things.
	- A lot of focus in those early years was on Quant Macro, and that was something.
	- Parallel to that, we started trading quant equity in 2001.
	- In 2009, started making an approach to short term trading. Intraday data, statistical models with about a holding period of 1 week.
	- In the early 2000s, even CAR had a 60% allocation to trend.
	- Summer of 2014, "we actually made a strategic shift in the allocation within CAR to be roughly equally balanced between the four investment styles [i.e., trend-following, quant macro, quant equity market neutral, short term trading]"
	- "In any given year, we typically add about 5-10 new models to portfolio and that's what gets us to 130 alphas and CAR today".
- "we can take advantage of the embedded in these markets we trade to really create a portfolio that [â€¦] can actually get a lot of the upside benefits of trend but also have some of the benefits other approaches".
	- "We wrote a paper a few years back on using the idea of embedded leverage"
	- For example: you allocate to 4 managers specializing in each of the investment styles we have, i.e. trend-following, equity market neutral, short term trading, and quant macro.
		- Let's say each of those delivered a 0 correlation, and 10% vol and 0.5 Sharpe.
		- "The combined allocation would have a Sharpe of 1, and that's pretty attractive. But the combined vol would drop to 5%".
		- Because we're running all of these in a single portfolio, we can manage the underlying leverage of the strategies and make sure we hit the target vol on the portfolio level.
- "the portfolio construction approach that we follow would also consider things like correlation among models".
- "the central risk we face as quants is overfitting"
- "our edge is in what we call a 'meta model' that we built and refine over the past 20 years or so, and it's not any one particular model in the portfolio"
	- "We can do high quality research.
	- We can evaluate new ideas and reject the ideas that don't hold up under scrutiny.
	- We can apply this to a wide range of market, investment styles, time horizons, and so on".
- "About half of our trades are Relative Value"
- Discarding the models? Not all the models stick around. How do you handle that? How are you making that decision? What are the conditions you are looking for to ultimately give up on a signal?
	- How we add:
		- What is their investment thesis?
		- What is the out-sample data to be set aside?
		- If an idea shows promise, we would take it to a formal peer review, and invite researchers from other teams to participate.
		- Go to the investment committee for a final approval.
	- How do we decide when to remove models:
		- "Sharpe of any particular model may not be extremely high and so we have to accept that some variation and some periods of underperformance is natural, especially when we're looking to make sure we're preserving that diversification among models".
		- "You don't want to always be cutting something immediately when it loses and then end up with a concentrated portfolio".
		- We used statistical guidance to help with determining when to discard a model. Expected Sharpe, the vol the model's running at and some other features like that. "We are able to judge in live trading 'is it within the range of expectations of it outcomes' in terms of performance, or drawdowns".
		- When a model goes out of its range of expectations, we give it a 50% haircut initially, and continue to monitor. If it goes above a threshold, we re-deploy it with full capital. That typically the case that happens.
		- Typically in any given year, we remove 1-2 models.

-   Do you find that certain types of models have a longer expected lifespan than other?
	- "I can't say we find that. I don't think we've necessarily seen that [any such pattern in the longevity of a model based on its characteristics such the time horizon, or type of models, etc.]"

-   Risk management
	- "The vast majority of our risk management process is systematic"
	- Three layers of risk:
		1.  Day-to-day variations: can be well modeled with statistical distributions
		2.  Tail-risk: things that involve outsized moves; we can set CVaR limits, and those kinds of things, again that's systematic
		3.  Unknown risks: can't be modeled, for example: Brexit, the early day of Covid, Russia-Ukraine crisis.
- Post-2008, we had risk-on, risk-off risk factors. Post-Covid, it changed the way different markets traded with each other, and there were this Covid-on, Covid-off factors.
- "Talk to me a little bit more about how you're identifying these emerging risk factors at anytime and working with the team to try to capture them quantitatively? And how that flows through the risk management process"?
	- "We're working with our trading desk, with our counter-parties, with the research team, thinking about what risks might be emerging. What might we be missing".

- "Campbell's flagship program is offered as a managed account; it's offered in a pooled vehicle structure as well as within a mutual fund"
- A lot of the managed futures firms were expanding into researching different types of signals during 2010s. Where did a lot of those firms that didn't do so well go wrong?
	- "they weren't experienced in looking into those new areas"
	- "The first place to look would be all the research that was coming out of the time on alt-risk-premia. They may have been looking at standard carry or standard value type factors, and some of those got pretty commoditized because there's a lot of money chasing them. I think if you were just looking in those well-defined areas, that might not have been the most fruitful"

- "There is an inherent tension in that the ideas that have the most robust empirical support probably are also at the most risk of being commoditized, and perhaps the concepts that have the greatest opportunities are those that can't be validated across long backtests and across broad set of markets".
	- "might be an emerging phenomenon", etc.
	- "these models don't represent a major allocation of portfolios today"
