- "Assets are facing significant headwinds from inflation and Fed tightening, but not holding assets is not an option"
- "Alpha can be extremely valuable, but it is difficult to generate and difficult to find at scale; […] explains why roughly 90% of the risk in a typical institutional portfolio comes from the strategic asset allocation"
- "Our approach to building a total portfolio has always been to build the best beta you can, independent of any active views, and then carefully layer in a diversified set of alphas to the degree that you have them or can find them in manager alpha"
- "the biggest vulnerabilities of typical portfolios are to falling discounted growth and rising discounted inflation, and we see the likelihood of that combination going forward–stagflation–to be the highest it has been in 100 years"
- "A balanced portfolio is designed to take that [stagflation] risk off the table by going neutral to growth and inflation in the first place. And you don't have to give up expected return to do this"![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.25.22 PM.png]]

- Rising Risk Premium and Discount Rates Have Hurt All Asset; the Big Shifts in Discounted Growth and Inflation That Are Particularly Bad for Equities and Typical Portfolios Have Not Yet Occurred![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.26.53 PM.png]]
	- "risk premiums and discount rates rose, hurting all assets. This is the risk inherent to beta, and there is no way of diversifying it away"
	- YTD, "equities outperformed global nominal and inflation-linked bonds on a risk-adjusted basis"
	- "however you cut it, major shifts in market pricing that are particularly bad for equities and typical portfolio haven't yet occurred"
		- "while the move in discounted inflation can look big up close, it's actually modest by historical standards. It's nothing like what we saw in 1970s and what we'd expect to see when markets price in a secular shift in inflation"![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.27.27 PM.png]]
	- "If you were to run a balanced portfolio at the same long-term return as a global 60/40, its drawdown year-to-date would have been significantly smaller (roughly half the size)"

- The Risk of Stagflation Is Growing; That Tends to Be the Worst Environment for Most Portfolios and the One Where the Benefit of Balance Is Greatest![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.28.14 PM.png]]
	- "We haven't seen stagflation yet, but (for what it's worth) we think that's likely where we're headed"
	- "we assess the pressure for stagflation relative to market discounting to be the highest it's been in about 100 years"

- A Continued Tightening Faster Than Markets Are Discounting Would Weigh on All Assets but with a Range of Outcomes Depending on How Aggressive
	- "**For a balanced portfolio, the key question is what will happen with […] risk premiums and discount rates, and a key driver of this will be how aggressively central banks will tighten in the face of rising inflation and a weak economy (and how market pricing of this will change)**"
	- "A tightening faster than markets are discounting would be a headwind to all assets, but how much faster matters a lot"
	- "in the year after the end of tightening–i.e., once the tightening bites and the economy starts to slow–balance significantly outperforms concentration on average, due to its exposure to assets that do well in falling growth"

- Returns of a Balanced Portfolio Tend to Normalize Over Time; Concentrated Portfolios Can Experience Lost Decades![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.34.12 PM.png]]
	- "Returns from risk premiums and discount rates tend to normalize over longer periods of time"
	- "a global 60/40 experienced a lost decade during the stagflationary 1970s"![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.35.53 PM.png]]

- A Balanced Portfolio Can Do as Well in Rising Versus Falling Interest Rate Environments
	- "a balanced portfolio holds more nominal bonds than a typical one"![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.36.20 PM.png]]

- The Need for an Alternative to Correlation-Based Diversification
	- "what will provide diversification is changing as well"
	- "equities and bonds have become positively correlated, after being mostly negative correlated over recent decades. And equities and commodities have become diversifying, after being highly correlated for many years"
	- "relying on trailing correlations to get diversification won't work"
		- The box shows "the biases of equities, nominal bonds, and commodities by placing them in their respective quadrants"![[Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 1.36.45 PM.png]]
		- "when growth is the dominant driver (as it was over recent decades), [equities and bonds] will be negatively correlated […] when inflation is the dominant driver (as it has been recently), they will be positively correlated"
		- "Equities and commodities have similar biases to growth but opposite biases to inflation, so they will be positively correlated when growth is dominant but negatively correlated when inflation is dominant"
	- "without predicting what the dominant macro driver will, you can't know what the correlation between assets will be"
		- Balanced portfolio balances to the "fundamental drivers in the first place" so there is no need to predict the dominant macro driver.

- The Challenges of Investing in This Environment
	- Components of portfolio return:
		- The risk-neutral position: "what an investor would hold in order not to take risk"
		- Beta
		- Alpha
	- "just as cross-asset correlations are changing, so too are the macro linkages relative to what we've lived through over the past 40 years. So, approaches to alpha that are grounded in the relationships that worked in the past are liable to struggle"
	- "how to get portfolio diversification in a world in which inflation is the dominant driver and stagflation a quite possible outcome"
